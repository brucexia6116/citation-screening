When irradiating targets in the brain, an accurately localised dose is often needed. One crucial moment to achieve this is the positioning of the patient. We have developed a positioning method where the patient is immobilised with a bite block and a head mould, and where the position of the target is determined by X-ray imaging of fiducial markers that are placed in the patient's skull. A method for computing the transformation needed to move the target from the observed to the prescribed position and orientation is described. This method uses the information from two orthogonal X-ray images and takes measurement errors and data from three or more markers into account. Results from using the method clinically in proton beam therapy are given
