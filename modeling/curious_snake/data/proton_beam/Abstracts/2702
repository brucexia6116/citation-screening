A system of computer programs has been created to allow the entry of radiotherapy treatment details as defined by the physician, the verification of the machine parameters at every treatment, and the recording of the entire course of treatment. Various utility programs are available to simplify the use and maintenance of the system. The majority of the code is written in FORTRAN-77, the remainder in MACRO-11. The system has been implemented on a PDP 11/60 minicomputer for use with a Mevatron linear accelerator, the implementation required minor hardware changes to the accelerator
