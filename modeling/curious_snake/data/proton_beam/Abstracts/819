A technique for producing a quantitative measure of magnetization transfer parameters in a clinically feasible time scale is proposed. The combination of pulsed off-resonance irradiation and echo planar imaging has produced an imaging sequence that negates the need for continuous wave irradiation and allows the approach to steady-state conditions to be studied. Data analysis involves the step-by-step numerical solution of the modified Bloch equations to generate a quantitative model of the measured signal intensity based on the relative size of the bound proton pool and the bound proton pool transverse relaxation time. The sequence and model are applied to the study of a series of agar gels of varying concentrations and the results are compared to those from the literature. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc
