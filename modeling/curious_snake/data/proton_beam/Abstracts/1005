The purpose of this study is to investigate the normal tissue damage caused by carbon-ion therapy. We measured chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes before, during, and after radiotherapy, using the techniques of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chemically induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC). Twenty-two lung cancer patients treated at HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) entered the study and signed an informed consent. Frequencies of lymphocytes with chromosomal aberrations at the end of carbon-ion therapy varied among the patients. This frequency was significantly correlated to the radiation field size and weakly correlated to the counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes during the treatment. As a result, we have found that chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients treated for lung cancer by carbon-ions were dependent on target volume, possibly reflecting the increased involvement of lymph nodes in the target field
