Current interest in attempting to identify any therapeutic advantages of beams of heavy particles (heavier than electrons) over photons is based on differences in physical absorption and radiobiologic interactions. The article discusses: dose distributions in tissue, which are markedly different for particles than for high energy photons and so may be clinically advantageous for the former; differences in radiobiologic responses, which could lead to increased tumor cell killing and a possible increase in the therapeutic ratio for particles; clinical experience to date; directions for and impediments to future research
