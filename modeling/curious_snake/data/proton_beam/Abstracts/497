Contents of 11 microelements (Se, Rb, K, Sr, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn) in various parts (zone of infarction, of scar, periinfaction zone) of left ventricular myocardium of patients with ischemic heart disease was studied with method of rentgenofluorescent analysis with the use of synchrotron irradiation (overall 2112 analyses). Left ventricular myocardium of victims of accidents without cardiovascular pathology was studied as control. Compared with control dysbalance of various degree was noted in left ventricular myocardium of patients with ischemic heart disease. Four groups of microelements were distinguished: lowered content (Se, Rb, K); close to normal content (Mn, Cu); moderately elevated content (Cr, Sr, Fe); elevated content (Ni, Zn). Several orders of magnitude elevation of Ni and Zn was noted in all parts of left ventricle, especially in the zone of infarction and periinfarction zone
