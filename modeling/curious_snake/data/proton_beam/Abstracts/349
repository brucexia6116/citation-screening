The geometric locations of ion traversals in mammalian cells constitute important information in the study of heavy ion-induced biological effects. We employed a contact microscopy technique, which was developed for boron imaging in boron neutron capture therapy to the irradiation mammalian cells by low-energy heavy ions. This method enables the simultaneous visualization of mammalian cells as a relief on a plastic track detector, CR-39, and the etch pits which indicate the positions of ion traversals. This technique provides visual geometric information about the cells and ion traversal, without any specially designed devices or microscopes. Only common laboratory equipment, such as a conventional optical microscope, a UV lamp, and commercially available CR-39 is required. To validate this method, CHO-K1 and HeLa cells were cultured on the CR-39 surface and then irradiated with low-energy Ar and Ne ions, respectively. The positions of induced DNA double strand breaks were detected as gamma-H2AX fluorescent spots, which coincided with the positions of the etch pits in the cell relief image
