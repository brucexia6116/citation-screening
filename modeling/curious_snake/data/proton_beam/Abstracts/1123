Proton therapy has the potential for high-precision radiotherapy of retinal tumors. However, the standardized eye models currently used do not fully account for the patient's individual anatomy. To better exploit the data provided by MR images, a model-based approach was used based on a database of eye models. A face recognition algorithm was advanced to define similarity criteria between the reference image and the actual image. After building a high-dimensional feature vector and using a training data set, the reference model was selected by using the minimum Mahalanobis distance between the image to be classified and the reference images
