Irradiation techniques should be judged not by dose distribution only but also by the effort necessary for their realization. Skip pendulum irradiation is a technique excelling not only through suitable dose distribution but through effortless adjustment as well. The possibilities of variation in skip pendulum irradiation are examined, a schedule facilitates the choice of field breadth and pendulum angle. Skip pendulum irradiation should gain importance, too, for the bremsstrahlung from a linear accelerator
