PURPOSE: To assess the potential influence of improved dose distribution with proton beams compared to conventional or intensity-modulated (IM) X-ray beams on the incidence of treatment-induced secondary cancers in pediatric oncology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two children, one with a parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and a second with a medulloblastoma, were used as models for the purpose of this study. After defining the target and critical structures, treatment plans were calculated and optimized, four for the RMS case (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons, and IM protons) and three for the irradiation of the spinal axis in medulloblastoma (conventional X-ray, IM X-rays, protons). Secondary cancer incidence was estimated using a model based on Publication No. 60 of the International Commission on Radiologic Protection. This model allowed estimation of absolute risks of secondary cancer for each treatment plan based on dose-volume distributions for the nontarget organs. RESULTS: Proton beams reduced the expected incidence of radiation-induced secondary cancers for the RMS patient by a factor of >or=2 and for the medulloblastoma case by a factor of 8 to 15 when compared with either IM or conventional X-ray plans. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for a significant reduction in secondary cancers with pediatric cancers after using proton beams (forward planned or IM) in the treatment of RMS and MBD in children and adolescents represents an additional argument supporting the development of proton therapy for most radiotherapy indications in pediatric oncology
