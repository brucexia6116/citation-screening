The induction of chromosome damage by the exposure to low doses of gamma-(60)Co and accelerated carbon ions 12C in peripheral blood lymphocytes of different donors was investigated. The complex nonlinear dose-effect dependence at the range from 1 to 50-70 cGy was observed. At the doses of 1-5 cGy the cells show the highest radiosensitivity (hypersensitivity), mainly due to the chromatid-type aberration, which is typical to those spontaneously generated in the cell and believed not to be induced by the irradiation of unstimulated lymphocytes according to the classical theory of aberration formation. With the increasing dose the frequency of the aberrations decreases significantly, in some cases up to the control level. At the doses over 50-70 cGy the dose-effect curve becomes linear. The possible role of the oxidative stress, caused by radiation-induced increase in mitochondrial reactive oxigen species (ROS) release in the phenomenon of hypersensitivity (HS) at low doses is discussed as well as cytoprotective mechanisms causing the increased radioresistance at higher doses
