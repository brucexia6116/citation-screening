Conventional external beam radiation has proved its profit in pediatric tumors; but its complications have limited it in therapeutical approach. Intraoperative radiotherapy delivers a high single dose in residual tumor or high risk areas during surgery. In our center, during last two years, 7 patients have been candidates to surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy (the age range was between 5 months-17 years; mean 8.5 years). Two patients were excluded of our protocol because of their intraoperative stage. Patients tumors types were: neuroblastoma (n = 3; stage III and IV), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 1) and Ewing's sarcoma (n = 1). The radiation doses ranged from 500 cGyto-1200 cGy. Local control tumor was achieved in 4 patients and no-complications were present secondary to surgery or intraoperative radiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy seems to be a feasible treatment which might promote local control in pediatric tumors with protection of normal tissues and could be an excellent complement in special cases
