Acute subarachnoidal hemorrhage or focal epilepsy in 5 patients was shown to be based on inoperable arteriovenous brain malformations (ABM) which was treated with the help of a linear accelerator. In one case 1 year 9 months after irradiation repeated hemorrhage was noted, the malformation was removed by an open surgical method. Clinical convalescence after irradiation was observed in the other 4 patients without side-effects during a follow-up period of 1-3 yrs. Angiography after irradiation was not performed. Teleroentgenotherapy was regarded as a good alternative in the treatment ofinoperable arteriovenous brain malformations
