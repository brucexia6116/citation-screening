A comparative study was undertaken to examine intracranial irradiation using intensity-modulation radiation therapy (IMRT) and linear accelerator-based radiosurgery. The IMRT was examined using the Peacock system with a BEAK attachment. A clinical case involving a metastatic brain lesion, treated with 3 radiosurgery isocenters, was planned for IMRT. The radiosurgery was planned using the Leibinger planning system. The IMRT was planned using the CORVUS planning system. The CORVUS planning system uses an inverse planning algorithm, a recent development in radiotherapy. Isodose distributions and dose volume histograms were generated and compared. Analysis of the dosimetry shows that the dose conformity and homogeneity within the target using the RTOG guidelines are superior for IMRT. The advantages of IMRT using inverse planning system include the ease of planning and execution of treatment, especially for cases that involve concave targets that require multiple isocenters using radiosurgery
