We investigated the spatial distribution of the induction of the phosphorylated form of the histone protein H2AX (gamma-H2AX), known to be activated by DSBs. Following irradiation of human fibroblast cells with 600 MeV/nucleon silicon and 600 MeV/nucleon iron ions we observed the formation of gamma-H2AX aggregates in the shape of streaks stretching over several micrometers in an x/y plane. Polyethylene shielding was used to achieve a Bragg curve distribution with beam geometry parallel to the monolayer of cells. We present data that highlights the formation of immunofluorescent gamma-H2AX tracks showing the ion trajectories across the Bragg peak of irradiated human fibroblast cells. Qualitative analyses of these distributions indicated potentially increased clustering of DNA damage before the Bragg peak, enhanced gamma-H2AX distribution at the peak, and provided visual evidence of high-linear energy transfer particle traversal of cells beyond the Bragg peak in agreement with one-dimensional transport approximations. Spatial assessment of gamma-H2AX fluorescence may provide direct insights into DNA damage across the Bragg curve for high charge and energy ions including the biological consequences of shielding and possible contributors to bystander effects. c2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of COSPAR
