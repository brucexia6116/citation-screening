AIM: The effect of ionizing irradiation on telomerase activity and further associated biological factors was evaluated in a human Ewing tumor xenograft model on nude mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The human Ewing tumor cell line STA-ET-1 was established in a nude mouse model. Initially, the dose-response relationship for the tumor model was established. For the radiation experiments two dose levels were chosen: 5 Gy and 30 Gy. After 5 Gy, there was no significant growth delay whereas after 30 Gy there was a marked growth delay without the induction of a complete remission. Tumors were examined 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post irradiation. After irradiation with 30 Gy further time points were 6, 9, 12 and 15 days. For each dose and time group, three tumors were evaluated. RESULTS: There was a reduction of telomerase activity after 5 Gy to 50% (not statistically significant) after 3 days; however, after 30 Gy there was a reduction of telomerase activity to 23% of the initial value after 6 days (p = 0.001). Telomerase activity correlated with the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), but not with the expression of telomerase-associated protein (TP1) and human telomerase RNA (hTR). The maximal amounts of necrosis or apoptosis after 30 Gy were 19% and 6.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ionizing radiation reduces telomerase activity and the expression of hTERT which cannot be explained by the induction of necrosis or apoptosis alone. The reduction of telomerase activity may contribute to delayed cell death after radiotherapy. The combined use of radiation and specific telomerase inhibitors may be a potentially synergistic treatment strategy
