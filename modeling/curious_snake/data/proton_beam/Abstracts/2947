A technique employing single fraction neutron radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial vascular malformations has been developed at the University of Washington and is described in this report. The natural history of arteriovenous malformations of the brain is briefly reviewed, along with currently available therapeutic methods for treatment of these lesions. The characteristics of the neutron beam used for radiosurgery are described, along with methods for patient immobilization, radiation treatment planning, dosimetry, and delivery of treatment using this technique
