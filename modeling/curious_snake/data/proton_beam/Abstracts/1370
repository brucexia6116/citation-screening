BACKGROUND: Angiomatous lesions of the conjunctiva and chronic conjunctivitis are frequently difficult to differentiate. CASE: A 28 year old white male sought help because of a conjunctival swelling. A biopsy made elsewhere had revealed a capillary haemangioma of the conjunctiva. Recently striking alterations of the skin led to the suspicion of a Kaposi's sarcoma. Immunohistochemical and dermatological examinations confirmed the diagnosis of a Kaposi's sarcoma and viral testing of serum revealed an HIV-infection. Besides intensive antiviral therapy, our patient underwent local irradiation of the right eye, the nose and of the left shoulder with an external beam. CONCLUSIONS: Kaposi's sarcoma is the most frequent Aids-associated malignant tumor. In about 30% of all patients with Aids, a Kaposi's sarcoma is diagnosed. The angiomatous character may lead to the histopathological diagnosis of a haemangioma.Human herpes virus 8 is known to be the transforming element
