A combination of reverse phase and normal phase high pressure liquid chromatography has been used to separate the reduced oligosaccharides produced by alkaline borohydride degradation of a blood group A ovarian cyst mucin glycoproteins. Fourteen compounds, ranging in size from a monosaccharide to a decasaccharide, have been isolated preparatively using a Zorbax C-18 reverse phase column eluted with water and a MicroPak AX-5 normal phase column eluted with aqueous acetonitrile. The purity of the products and their structures were determined from the fully assigned high field proton NMR spectra. The resonances of exchangeable amide protons, observed by the Redfield selective pulse sequence in H2O, were assigned by decoupling to the resonances of H2 of the 2-acetamido sugars. Nuclear Overhauser effects were used to establish the relationship of the anomeric protons and those of the aglycone. In exception to earlier proposals that nuclear Overhauser effect on irradiation of the anomeric proton should always be observed at the proton attached to the aglycone carbon, we find that for the linkage of GalNAcp(1----3)Gal, nuclear Overhauser effect on irradiation of the alpha-anomeric proton resonance is observed not at H3 but at H4 of galactose. A combination of NMR methods and enzymatic degradation was employed to determine the structures of 13 different oligosaccharides of which seven have not previously been reported. These oligosaccharides, which terminate with beta-Gal, alpha-Fuc, beta-GlcNAc, and alpha-GalNAc, account for 75% of the total glycoprotein carbohydrate, the remainder being isolated as a mixture of glycopeptides and a high molecular weight polysaccharide whose NMR spectrum implies a simple repeating subunit structure closely related to that of the oligosaccharides
