Nitrobenzylthioninosine, a potent nucleoside-transport inhibitor, binds specifically to functional nucleoside transport sites. Irradiation of freeze-dried human erythrocyte membranes with high-energy electrons was used to estimate the apparent molecular weight of the nitrobenzylthioninosine-binding complex in situ. The nitrobenzylthioinosine-binding complex had an apparent mol.wt. of 122000
