An alternate method to measure the phantom scatter factor in small fields is provided for high energy photon beams. The measurement technique is based on the density scaling theorem described by O'Connor [Phys. Med. Biol. 1, 352-369 (1957)]. The phantom scatter factor (Sp) is measured in balsa and cedar wood to give effective field sizes in 3 x 3 to 0.5 x 0.5 cm2 water. The extrapolated zero area phantom scatter factor from the average data of balsa and cedar is 0.45. This indicates that the variation of output is largely due to a sharp decrease in the phantom scatter factor for small field sizes
