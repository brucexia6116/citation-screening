The question of the adequacy of isocentric linear accelerators (linacs) for use in radiosurgery is addressed. The general physical requirements for radiosurgery, mainly a high spatial and numerical accuracy of dose delivery, reasonable treatment time, and low skin and leakage dose as well as cost considerations are examined. Various linac-based procedures are analyzed in view of their ability to meet these requirements and are contrasted with the clinically proven system of the Gamma unit. It is shown that the linac-based multiple converging arcs techniques and the dynamic rotation meet the stringent physical requirements on dose delivery and are thus viable alternatives to radiosurgery with the commercially available and dedicated Gamma unit
