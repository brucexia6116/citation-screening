Microbeam radiosurgery (MBRS), also referred to as microbeam radiation therapy (MRT), was tested at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The left tibiofibular thigh of a mouse bearing a subcutaneously (sc) implanted mouse model (SCCVII) of aggressive human squamous-cell carcinoma was irradiated in two orthogonal exposures with or without a 16 mm aluminium filter through a multislit collimator (MSC) by arrays of nearly parallel microbeams spaced 200 microm on centre (oc). The peak skin-entrance dose from each exposure was 442 Gy, 625 Gy, or 884 Gy from 35 microm wide beams or 442 Gy from 70 microm wide beams. The 442/35, 625/35, 884/35 and 442/70 MBRSs yielded 25 day, 29 day, 37 day and 35 day median survival times (MST) (post-irradiation), respectively, exceeding the 20 day MST from 35 Gy-irradiation of SCCVIIs with a seamless 100 kVp X-ray beam
