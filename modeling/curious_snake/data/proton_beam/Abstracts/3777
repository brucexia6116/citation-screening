Irradiation with visible light of human serum albumin in aqueous solution at pH 8, in the presence of catalytic amounts of rose bengal or methylene blue, resulted in random oxidation of the histidine residues in the protein under consumption of one mole O2, and release of somewhat less than one proton, per histidine residue degraded. An increase of light absorption at 250 nm was proportional to the amount of oxygen consumed. Bilirubin bound to the oxidized protein showed an increased light absorption at its maximum, 460 nm, and a decreased binding affinity, indicating a conformational change of the protein on oxidation of histidine residues. This change also resulted in a slight perturbation of tyrosine light absorption, corresponding to a shift of the chromophore to more polar surroundings. Further, a sensitized oligomerization of albumin was observed, independent of oxidation of the histidine residues, and not consuming oxygen. Irradiation of a complex of human serum albumin with one molecule of bound bilirubin, in the absence of a sensitizing dye, resulted in a fast, non-oxygen consuming process whereby the light absorption maximum of the pigment was shifted 4 nm towards longer wavelength and part of the bilirubin was converted to a more polar pigment, bound less firmly to the protein. This was followed by a relatively slow oxidation of the pigment under uptake of one mole O2. Parallel photooxidation of the protein carrier could not be detected. It is considered possible that the fast, anaerobic process is operative in phototherapy of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn. Serum albumin is probably not oxidized during this treatment
