Twenty-one patients with adenocarcinoma of the cecum received post-operative local and regional radiation therapy, using two fractions per day. Six lesions were too extensive for any attempt at removal, and none of these was controlled by the irradiation. However, there have been no local recurrences among the 15 who had all or most of the local tumor excised. This local control rate is significantly better than that reported for definitive surgery alone
