The advent of mobile LINACs for use in intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) promises to make IORT more accessible than before and easier to deliver to patients undergoing surgery. Although mobile IORT systems have been available since 1999, few treatment centers currently use them. Here, we present the case of a typical patient undergoing IORT for retroperitoneal sarcoma to show how easy these mobile systems are to use and how adaptable they are within the operating room (OR) environment. We also discuss the roles and coordination of multidisciplinary team members during IORT and the feasibility of using mobile LINACs for IORT
