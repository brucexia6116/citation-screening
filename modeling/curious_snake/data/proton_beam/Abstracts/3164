Solid Ehrlich mouse tumours were irradiated in the 80 MeV proton beam of the Paul-Scherrer-Institute. The tumour volume was measured as a function of time after irradiation and two experimental endpoints were determined: local tumour control and minimal tumour volume after irradiation. The application of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG; 2 mg/kg) increased the radiation effect of protons by a factor of 1.4. The same tumour system was used with negative pions. Human tumours are usually irradiated with a mixed radiation produced by the "spot-scan-technique". This radiation quality was simulated in the mouse experiment by two successive irradiations with a spot of densely ionizing peak pions and a spot of sparsely ionizing plateau pions. Application of 2-DG raised the radiation effect due to the sparsely ionizing component again by a factor of 1.4. This indicates that clinical results in radiotherapy might be improved by application of 2-DG during the treatment
