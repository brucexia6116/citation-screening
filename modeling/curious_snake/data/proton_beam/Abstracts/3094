PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to detect tumor cell viability, the diagnosis of which is the most important point in clinical therapy for malignant tumors. The advent of localized proton spectroscopy has made this detection possible. The spectral peak intensities were found to be very different depending on tumor tissue pathology. METHODS: The tumor cell reaction after radiation therapy was examined with proton localized spectroscopy in addition to enhanced MR imaging using a 1.5 Tesla MR system (Philips, Gyroscan S15-HP). Plain MR images (short spin echo) were used for localization pilot images, and after the MRS study, contrast enhanced MRI was carried out. Studies were performed pre-radiation, mid-radiation, and post-radiation if possible. MATERIALS: Sixteen patients (total 27 examinations) with intracranial tumors and three normal volunteers underwent proton NMR localized spectroscopy. The brain tumors were diagnosed before the MR study, and nine patients had metastatic brain tumors, such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma, and seven other patients were diagnosed with glioma-type tumors. RESULTS: The reaction patterns of proton NMR spectroscopy of brain tumors after radiation therapy were very different and depended on tumor histology. CONCLUSION: Proton NMR spectroscopy is an excellent means of determining tumor cell viability
