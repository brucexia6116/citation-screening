The leakage radiation from electron applicators used with our linear accelerator has been measured. For the applicators 6 X 6 to 25 X 25 cm size, the leakage was measured in the plane of the patient and on the sides of the applicators with the available electron energies of 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 MeV. The levels were significant. The highest leakage on the side was for the combination of 6 X 6-cm applicator and 9-MeV electrons (32%) and in the plane of the patient for 25 X 25-cm applicator with 18 MeV (10%) relative to the peak dose. Adding lead 1-2 mm, at appropriate locations inside the applicators has reduced the leakages to acceptable levels without affecting the beam parameters
