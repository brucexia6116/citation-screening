Proton beam irradiation has been used for the treatment of 241 uveal melanomas over the past 7 1/2 years. Twelve melanomas (5%) were small, 99 (41%) medium, 103 (43%) large and 27 (1%) extra-large melanomas. The mean length of follow-up was 21 months and the median 15 months. Ninety-four percent of the treated lesions with a follow-up more than two years and 65% of tumors with shorter follow-up showed regression. The most recent visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 47% and 20/100 or better in 66%. Ten eyes were enucleated because of complications (9) or continued tumor growth (1). Thirteen patients developed metastases from 4 to 50 months of treatment. Our data indicate that proton irradiation can be used to treat melanomas of various sizes and in a variety of locations, and preliminary results suggest that proton therapy has no deleterious effect on the likelihood of the development of metastases
