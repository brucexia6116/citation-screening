Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) offers a technique to minimize the absorbed dose to normal tissues; therefore, quality assurance is essential for these procedures. In this study, quality assurance for FSRT of 58 cases, between August 1995 and August 1997 are described, and the errors for each step and overall accuracy were estimated. Some of the important items for FSRT procedures are: accuracy in CT localization, transferred image distortion, laser alignment, isocentric accuracy of linear accelerator, head frame movement, portal verification, and various human errors. A geometric phantom, that has known coordinates was used to estimate the accuracy of CT localization. A treatment planning computer was used for checking the transferred image distortion. The mechanical isocenter standard (MIS), rectilinear phantom pointer: (RLPP), and laser target localizer frame (LTLF) were used for laser alignment and target coordinates setting. Head-frame stability check was performed by a depth confirmation helmet (DCH). A film test was done to check isocentric accuracy and portal verification. All measured data for the 58 patients were recorded and analyzed for each item. 4-MV x-rays from a linear accelerator, were used for FSRT, along with homemade circular cones with diameters from 20 to 70 mm (interval: 5 mm). The accuracy in CT localization was 1.2+/-0.5 mm. The isocentric accuracy of the linear accelerator, including laser alignment, was 0.5+/-0.2 mm. The reproducibility of the head frame was 1.1+/-0.6 mm. The overall accuracy was 1.7+/-0.7 mm, excluding human errors
