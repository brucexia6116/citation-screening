The paper is concerned with analysis of angiographic findings on 62 patients with arteriovenous aneurysms (AVA) of the cerebral vessels who received proton beam stereotactic therapy in the period of 1978-1986 depending on an absorbed dose value of an irradiated volume. Proton stereotactic therapy (PST) of brain AVA located deep in the functionally important regions, can be used as an independent radical therapeutic method in such cases including inoperable ones. Complete AVA elimination from the blood flow or considerable reduction of the AVA volume was achieved in 68% of the patients after delivering a dose of approximately 40 Gy, the AVA volume being approximately 30%. Significant (p less than 0.05) correlation of PST results, a dose of irradiation and a value of the AVA irradiated volume was established in the groups with positive results and in the nonresponding groups
