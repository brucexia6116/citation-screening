Dose uniformity within the treatment volume for tangent breast irradiation can be significantly improved through dynamic compensating collimation using all four independent jaws to define a superposition of sequentially reduced Enhanced dynamic wedge fields. The enhanced dynamic wedge angle is determined which optimizes dose uniformity in the central axis transverse plane, then the sequential reduction of the superior and inferior jaws is determined to optimize the sagittal dose uniformity. This technique could be applied under computer control through a record and verify system
