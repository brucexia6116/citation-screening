Radiation performance characteristics of a dedicated intraoperative accelerator were determined to prepare the unit for clinical use. The linear accelerator uses standing wave X-band technology (wavelength approximately 3 centimeters) in order to minimize the mass of the accelerator. The injector design, smaller accelerator components, and low electron beam currents minimize radiation leakage. The unit may be used in a standard operating room without additional shielding. The mass of the accelerator gantry is 1250 Kg (weight approximately 2750 lbs) and the unit is transportable between operating rooms. Nominal electron energies are 4, 6, 9, and 12 MeV, and operate at selectable dose rates of 2.5 or 10 Gray per minute. D(max) depths in water for a 10 cm applicator are 0.7, 1.3, 1.7, and 2.0 for these energies, respectively. The depths of 80% dose are 1.2, 2.1, 3.1, and 3.9 cm, respectively. Absolute calibration using the American Association of Physicists in Medicine TG-51 protocol was performed for all electron energies using the 10 cm applicator. Applicator sizes ranged from 3 to 10 cm diameter for flat applicators, and 3 to 6 cm diameter for 30 degrees beveled applicators. Output factors were determined for all energies relative to the 10 cm flat applicator. Central axis depth dose profiles and isodose plots were determined for every applicator and energy combination. A quality assurance protocol, performed each day before patient treatment, was developed for output and energy constancy
