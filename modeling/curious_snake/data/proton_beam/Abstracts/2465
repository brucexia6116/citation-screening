The postoperative period in 62 patients with lung cancer was studied in a comparative aspect. Preoperative use of radiotherapy influences but insignificantly the postoperative course. As a whole, the incidence of postoperative complications and mortality does not differ considerably from that in patients not irradiated with a Betatron. The state of blood coagulation was studied before and prior to surgery in 34 patients previously irradiated with a Betatron. Following the irradiation some changes indicative of hypocoagulation were revealed. In the early postoperative period (2d--10th day postoperatively) a marked increase in the fibrinogen "A" content is observed
