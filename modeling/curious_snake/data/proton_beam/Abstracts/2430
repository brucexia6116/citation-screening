Irradiation of ketoprofen in neutral aqueous medium gave rise to 3-ethylbenzophenone as the major photoproduct. Its formation is justified via protonation of a benzylic carbanion or hydrogen abstraction by a benzylic radical. Minor amounts of eight additional compounds were isolated. Four of them are derived from the benzylic radical: 3-(1-hydroperoxyethyl)benzophenone, 3-(1-hydroxyethyl)benzophenone, 3-acetylbenzophenone and 2,3-bis-(3-benzoylphenyl)butane. The other four products involve initial hydrogen abstraction by the excited benzophenone chromophore of ketoprofen: 1,2-bis-(3-ethylphenyl)-1,2-diphenyl-1,2-ethanediol, 2-(3-benzoylphenyl)-1-(3-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylpropan-1-ol, alpha-(3-ethylphenyl)phenylmethanol, 1,2-bis-[3-(2-hydroxycarbonylethyl) phenyl]-1,2-diphenyl-1,2-ethanediol. The latter process was found to mediate the photoperoxidation of linoleic acid through a type I mechanism, as evidenced by the inhibition produced by the radical scavengers butylated hydroxyanisole and reduced glutathione. The major photoproduct, which contains the benzophenone moiety but lacks the propionic acid side chain, also photosensitized linoleic acid peroxidation. Because lipid peroxidation is indicative of cell membrane lysis, the above findings are highly relevant to explain the photobiological properties of ketoprofen
