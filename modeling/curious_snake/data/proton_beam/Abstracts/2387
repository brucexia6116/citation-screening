We have investigated a bicentric stereotactic convergent beam irradiation technique for the treatment of irregularly shaped, especially elongated, target volumes. Depending on the size and shape of the target volume optimum values for the isocenter distance, collimator apertures and dose inhomogeneity have been determined which serve as starting parameters for the interactive optimization of dose distribution. The treatment planning system of the stereotactic unit SRS-200 (Philips) has been used to calculate the parameter tables. However, the presented results are also applicable to other stereotactic systems
