Chondrosarcomas are relatively rare tumors of the skull base. This article surveys the clinical and pathologic features of these lesions. In recent years there have been remarkable advances in both the imaging and treatment of these lesions. Both CT scanning and MR imaging are usually necessary for the complete evaluation of these tumors because of the involvement of both soft tissue and bony structures at the skull base. New surgical techniques and the use of high-energy proton beam irradiation have improved the prognosis for patients with these lesions. [References: 53]
