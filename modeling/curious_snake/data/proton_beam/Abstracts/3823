Thirty-nine patients with histologically confirmed invasive bladder carcinoma (T2-3, N0, M0) were treated with a partially accelerated radiotherapy scheme. After 40 Gy/4 weeks of conventional fractionation we have accelerated the treatment in the last week giving two daily fractions of 2 Gy each, 4-6 h apart in the bladder only. Although the follow-up of some of the patients is not very long our results indicate that this relatively short radiotherapeutic scheme is feasible, convenient and probably safe for patients living in remote areas
