Portal verification images were generated by the photon contamination in electron beams produced by a linear accelerator during treatment of patients receiving high-energy electron radiation therapy. Both conventional and storage phosphor methods yielded projection radiographs in which anatomy of the irradiated and surrounding tissue was demonstrated. Exposed phantoms were used to confirm that the images represent a true projection of the radiation field. A preliminary series of 22 cases was evaluated by two radiotherapists and judged subjectively to be of clinical value. Geometric error, or more importantly, the lack thereof, during high-energy electron treatments was easily confirmed with this method. In three cases, the treatment protocol was corrected based on the images obtained. Because the readout process of storage phosphor images allows for gain adjustments and post-processing, the images obtained with this method were found to delineate anatomy in the treated and surrounding tissues somewhat more consistently than could conventional images
