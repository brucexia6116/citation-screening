From 1952-1978, 177 patients with epidermoid carcinoma confined to the true vocal cords with normal mobility (T1NO) were treated with radiation alone. Five- and 10-year adjusted actuarial survival rates for all patients were 97 and 95%, respectively. The tumor recurred in the larynx and/or neck in 16% of patients with T1a (one cord involved) and 23% of the patients with T1b (both vocal cords involved) disease. Radiation failures were surgically salvaged in 89% of patients with T1a disease without anterior commissure involvement, in 60% of those with T1a disease with anterior commissure involvement and in 57% of those with T1b disease. Tumor was ultimately controlled in 97% of the patients with T1a and 90% of the patients with T1b disease. Voice was preserved in 93% of the patients with T1a disease and 77% of patients with T1b disease. Of 121 patients evaluated for voice quality, 77% had good and 22% had fair voice, while only one patient had poor quality of voice. Patients with fair or poor quality voice usually had had salvage hemilaryngectomy. We recommend radiation for all patients with early vocal cord carcinoma
