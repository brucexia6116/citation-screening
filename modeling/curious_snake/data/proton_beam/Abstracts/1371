Saturation transfer phenomena from irradiated protein protons to observed water protons in packed human red blood cells (RBCs) with normal or unstable hemoglobin (Hb), i.e. Hb Yokohama and Hb Koeln, were studied using intermolecular cross-relaxation rates [CR; 1/T(IS)(H(2)O)], action spectra [[1-(I(infinity)/I(0))] vs f(2) (ppm), where I(0) and I(infinity) are the longitudinal magnetization of observed water protons before and after long-time f(2)-irradiation, respectively], CR spectra [CR vs f(2) (ppm)] and CR ratio vs f(2) (ppm) with f(2)-irradiation from -100 to 100 ppm at gammaH(2)/2pi of 69 or 250 Hz. RBCs (Hb Yokohama) exhibited many large Heinz bodies and strongly impaired filterability, while RBCs (Hb Koeln) showed few microscopically typical Heinz bodies and virtually normal filterability. However, increases in CR values for RBCs (Hb Koeln) and RBCs (Hb Yokohama), monitored by f(2)-irradiation below approximately -6 and above approximately 14 ppm, clearly indicated marked increases in association or aggregation of unstable Hb in RBCs compared with those in normal RBCs. CR values, monitored between approximately 0 and approximately 10 ppm, were related to not only association or aggregation of unstable Hb but also amounts of water in RBCs. Aggregation or association of unstable Hb exhibited greater effects on CR values compared with those of methemoglobin formation. Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd
