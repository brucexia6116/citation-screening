Results are presented of measurements of skin sparing, penetration and total dose per unit of incident charge for various target thicknesses and filtrations for a neutron beam generated by 42 MeV protons on beryllium. These results are contrasted to predictions outlined in a previous paper. The differences from these predictions are attributed to the contribution of low-energy neutrons produced by the residual proton beam in the thick copper target backstop
