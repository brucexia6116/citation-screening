The production of 18F electrophilic reagents via the 18O(p,n)18F reaction has been investigated in small-volume target bodies made of aluminum, copper, gold-plated copper and nickel, having straight or conical bore shapes. Three irradiation protocols-single-step, two-step and modified two-step-were used for the recovery of the 18F activity. The single-step irradiation protocol was tested in all the target bodies. Based on the single-step performance, aluminum targets were utilized extensively in the investigation of the two-step and modified two-step irradiation protocols. With an 11-MeV cyclotron and using the two-step irradiation protocol, > 1Ci [18F]F2 was recovered reproducibly from an aluminum target body. Probable radical mechanisms for the formation of OF2 and FONO2 (fluorine nitrate) in the single-step and modified two-step targets are proposed based on the amount of ozone generated and the nitrogen impurity present in the target gases, respectively
