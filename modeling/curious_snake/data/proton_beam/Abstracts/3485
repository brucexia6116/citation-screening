Since 1982 79 patients with intracranial AVM's were irradiated at linear accelerator with 10 MV photons. Diagnosis, localization and therapy were done immobilizing the head for identical positioning. In a controlled study the therapy was done with fractionated irradiation up to 50 Gy in 25 fractions within 5 weeks or with 20 Gy in 4 fractions within 7 days. Complications, due to therapy, did not occur. Suffering from convulsion was not affected. Five patients have died, one patient got a hemorrhage 36 months later. The angiographical analysis of the first 25 patients until 30 months after radiotherapy gave complete obliterations and reduction of volume in more than 50% with minor AVM's. The result are not detrimental compared with a group after photon irradiation
