The authors have examined the possibility of preventing the development of secondary glaucoma after eye irradiation with a narrow medicinal proton beam. Twenty-eight patients with cilio-choroidal melanoma were involved in the study, 7 male and 21 female ones, aged 48.4 on an average. The authors' findings evidence that postradiation changes in the anterior segment of the eye, resulting from radiation iridocyclitis, are mainly responsible for the development of secondary glaucoma. Preliminary laser-effected formation of iridal coloboma is conducive to a normal flow in the anterior chamber at the expense of an additional pupil functioning and thus helps reduce the possibility of secondary glaucoma development by 1.6 times (or by 38.5%)
