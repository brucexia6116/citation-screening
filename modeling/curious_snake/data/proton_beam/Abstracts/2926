A non-invasive relocatable stereotactic frame has been developed for fractionated stereotactic external beam radiotherapy (SRT) by linear accelerator. Fixation is via the upper dentition and tests of repositioning have shown mean antero-posterior and lateral displacements of 1.0 mm. The relocatable frame allows accurate 3-dimensional target localisation by CT, MRI, PET and cerebral angiography and precise isocentric positioning for radiotherapy. This method of immobilisation is ideal for fractionated SRT as well as for other techniques requiring high precision localisation and treatment delivery
