The opportunity exists at present for the application of accelerator beam to clinical diagnosis in the Academic City of Tsukuba wherein the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK) and Tsukuba University Hospital are located. 250 MeV Proton beams have been available both for clinical proton therapy and experimental proton radiography at the Particle Radiation Medical Center (PARMS) (Tsukuba University). Monoenergetic protons are highly sensitive to density variations and are capable of giving radiographs of very high contrast. As an initial step in exploring their diagnostic potential, protons with energies of 250 MeV were used in the projection radiography of animals. Prior to the above experiments, some characteristics of the proton beam were examined. The detector system in this experiment was films with or without intensifying screens. The problem hampering diagnostic potential of proton radiography was multiple scattering
