Radiation therapy of tumors is often performed with high energy electrons. In certain situations air cavities in the irradiation volume can change the dose distribution. The effects of air cavities on the dose distribution are investigated. The results calculated with a therapy planning system and measured in a phantom are described and compared with one another and with the literature
