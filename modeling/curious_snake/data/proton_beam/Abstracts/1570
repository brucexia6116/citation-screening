The RBE for neutrons was assessed in a head-to-head experiment in which cultures of lymphocytes from the same male donor were irradiated simultaneously with 144 keV neutrons and with 60Co gamma rays as the reference radiation and evaluated using matched time, culture conditions, and the end point of chromosomal aberrations to avoid potential confounding factors that would influence the outcome of the experiment. In addition, the irradiation time was held constant at 2 h for the high-dose groups for both radiation types, which resulted in rather low dose rates. For the induction of dicentric chromosomes, the exposure to the 144 keV neutrons was found to be almost equally as effective (yield coefficient alpha(dic) = 0.786 +/- 0.066 dicentrics per cell per gray) as that found previously for irradiation with monoenergetic neutrons at 565 keV (alpha(dic) = 0.813 +/- 0.052 dicentrics per cell per gray) under comparable exposure and culture conditions (Radiat. Res. 154, 307-312, 2000). However, the values of the maximum low-dose RBE (RBE(m)) relative to 60Co gamma rays that were determined in the present and previous studies show an insignificant but conspicuous difference: 57.0 +/- 18.8 and 76.0 +/- 29.5, respectively. This difference is mainly due to the difference in the alpha(dic) value of the 60Co gamma rays, the reference radiation, which was 0.0138 +/- 0.0044 Gy(-1) in the present study and 0.0107 +/- 0.0041 Gy(-1) in the previous study. In the present experiment, irradiations with 144 keV neutrons and 60Co gamma rays were both performed at 21 degrees C, while in the earlier experiment irradiations with 565 keV neutrons were performed at 21 degrees C and the corresponding reference irradiation with gamma rays was performed at 37 degrees C. However, the temperature difference between 21 degrees C and 37 degrees C has a minor influence on the yield of chromosomal alterations and hence RBE values. The large cubic PMMA phantom that was used for the gamma irradiations in the present study results in a larger dose contribution from Compton-scattered photons compared to the mini-phantom used in the earlier experiments. The contribution of these scattered photons may explain the large value of alpha(dic) for gamma irradiation in the present study. These results indicate that the yield coefficient alpha(dic) for 144 keV neutrons is similar to the one for 565 keV neutrons, and that modification of the alpha(dic) value of the low-LET reference radiation, due to changes in the experimental conditions, can influence the RBE(m). Consequently, alpha(dic) values cannot be shared between cytogenetic laboratories for the purpose of assessment of RBM(m) without verification of the comparability of the experimental conditions
