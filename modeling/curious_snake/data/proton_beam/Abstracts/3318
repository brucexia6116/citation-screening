Electron beam outputs in the presence of beam shaping cutouts were measured for 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 MeV electrons from a Varian-20 linear accelerator. This machine was provided with a new model of electron cones, for which photon jaw sizes were set differently from those of old cones. The effects of different photon jaw sizes on the electron outputs were studied. Also measured was the absorbed dose under a cutout, which was presumably contributed by scattered electrons and bremsstrahlung photons
