Modern neuroimaging provides excellent characterization of anterior visual pathway gliomas, often obviating the need for biopsy of the tumor. Management remains controversial, but if there is progression, chemotherapy is preferred for young patients. Stereotactically guided conformal radiotherapy and proton beam radiotherapy allow smaller, more precise doses of radiation to be administered and can be considered in older children with progressive disease. A mouse model of NF-1 with optic pathway gliomas has the potential to provide important insights into the development of gliomas as well as serving as a model for their effective treatment.
