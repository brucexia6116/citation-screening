Intraocular melanoma is the most common primary ocular malignancy in Whites. Epidemiologic studies demonstrated the role of sun exposure as a risk for uveal melanoma. Conservative treatment techniques are indicated for localised tumors when feasible. External radiation therapy and radioactive eye plaque brachytherapy seem as effective as surgery in term of survival. High tumor doses can be safely administered with either helium or proton beams. A partial preservation of the vision is possible in most of patients. However, even for locally controlled patients, distant metastases can occur. Liver is the most frequent metastatic site, and also the first involved. Liver metastases are associated with a low response rate, to dacarbazine and nitrosourea. Recent studies using a new nitrosourea, fotemustine, administered locally through an intra-arterial catheter, show that it produces encouraging results with a good hepatic and hematologic tolerance.
