An ionometric dose intercomparison has been carried out on eight accelertors, with maximum photon energies from 6 to 32 meV, at five radiotherapy centres in Ontario. The ratio of the dose based on the clinically-employed rad/monitor unit to the dose measured by the committee representative had a mean value of 0.994, with a range of 7.3% and a coefficient of variation of 2.5%. The ratio of the dose measured by the institution's physicist to the dose measured by the committee representative had a mean value of 1.000 with a range of 6.9% and a coefficient of variation of 2.3%. Eight recommendations regarding dose calibration procedures are presented
