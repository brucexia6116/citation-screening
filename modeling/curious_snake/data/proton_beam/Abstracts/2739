The article is devoted to the results of application of high energy proton beams, negative pi-mesons and neutrons in biomedical and clinical investigations carried out at the 680 MeV phasotron (the JINR Laboratory of Nuclear Problems) before its conversion. A six-compartment clinico-physical facility is described. It has been constructed at the converted phasotron in order to continue and expand investigations for application of heavy nuclear particles in radiation therapy. The first physical and dosimetric characteristics of medical proton beams produced in the converted accelerator and guided to chambers 1 and 2 of the new clinico-physical facility are discussed. The future of radiobiological and clinical investigations with high energy proton, negative pion and neutron beams of this facility is also discussed
