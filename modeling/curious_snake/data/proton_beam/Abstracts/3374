Consistent collimator overlaps in field matching with computer-controlled asymmetric x-ray collimators have been observed and investigated. The results indicate that, although this consistent overlapping is small and within manufacturer's +/- 1 mm discrepancy specification, it can produce more than 10% cold spots at matchlines if unheeded. This undesirable dose inhomogeneity, however, can be improved to within +/- 3% with a simple and practical solution of artificially offsetting the collimators by exactly the same amount (e.g., 1 mm) they overlap
