PURPOSE: In the proton radiotherapy, primary proton beams contribute to the absorbed dose and the share of secondary charged-particles is small. The purpose is to discuss about the ratio of average dose of primary proton beams and secondary charged-particles. METHODS: We performed the dosimetry of 70 MeV proton beams in water using ionization chamber. The ratio of average dose for secondary charged-particles in some range shifter was calculated by the dose ratio of primary and scatter. To exclude the influence of lateral secondary charged-particles, the ratio of average dose for secondary charged-particles was extrapolated to zero field size of each. RESULTS: The ratio of average dose for secondary charged-particles was extrapolated to zero field size by the bi-exponential fit. The ratio of average dose for longitudinal secondary charged-particles for zero fields at each depth is almost the same; the different at the shallow depth is decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The secondary charged-particles from collimator is affected by the dose of shallow depth. The influence of lateral secondary charged-particles in water phantom was excluded with the extrapolation method for zero field size in each depth
