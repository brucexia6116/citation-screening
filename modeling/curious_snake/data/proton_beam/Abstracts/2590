The survival of 232 patients with apparently localized carcinoma of the prostate is reported, who were treated between October 1964 and October 1984 by a radical course of external beam radiotherapy using a hypofractionation technique. Assessment was made in a retrospective analysis, noting influence of age, stage of disease at presentation, initial histology, dose of radiotherapy given and any subsequent treatment required, recorded up to October 1986. From this it will be seen that the development of a six fraction regime, given over a period of three weeks leads to comparable results to other reported series, whether assessed as a local response or by survival curves, and to the economical use of scarce resources, but even more important, is less wearing for patients than daily fractionation, with early and late morbidity being within acceptable limits
