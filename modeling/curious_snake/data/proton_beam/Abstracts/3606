Basic investigation into the nature of melanin monomer and polymer synthesis in pigment cells has revealed many of the new underlying factors involved in its regulation and control by three melanogenesis-related genes, tyrosinase, TRP-1 and TRP-2, and other non-tyrosinase glycoproteins. Pigment cells can undergo clinically and biologically recognizable progressive multi-step carcinogenesis. Generally parallel to this progressive cancerization is accentuated melanogenesis. Using this accentuated melanogenesis to develop a specific diagnosis and cure for melanoma (Mm) has long been a challenge. However, until recently, no success was achieved. As an example, attempting to utilize the fact that dopa accumulates as a melanin substrate within Mm cells, hybrid compounds of dopa and cytotoxic drugs were developed. However, these compounds were found to have severe systemic side effects and were therefore unusable. Another newer Mm treatment involves high energy radiation such as fast neutrons. But this is quite non-selective, killing both the target cancer and the normal surrounding tissue. Since 1972, I have developed the idea of coupling the high energy releasing system of thermal neutron irradiation with the non-toxic 10B-dopa analogue, 10B1-L-p-boronophenylalanine (10B1-L-BPA). Thermal neutrons are essentially harmless, but, after specific absorption by 10B, release high LET alpha-particles and 7Li-atoms with an energy of 2.33 MeV up to a distance of 14 mu, the diameter of Mm cells, thus selectively killing them without damaging surrounding normal tissue. After the synthesis of 10B1-L-BPA, exhaustive in vitro and in vivo radiological studies on its enhanced killing effect were done to develop optimal Mm Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (NCT).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
