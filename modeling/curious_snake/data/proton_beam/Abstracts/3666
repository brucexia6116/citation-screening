Both small and irregular fields are frequently the treatment of choice in many clinical applications of electron therapy. The fields are often shaped by lead or low melting point alloy placed at the end of the cone or on the patient's surface. The dosimetry for electrons of energies of 4, 6, 8, and 10 MeV is examined with particular emphasis on very small fields for treatment such as the lip, nose, and eye and irregular fields of various area/perimeter ratios. The paper discusses the dosimetry correction due to field shaping as a function of the location of the shield
