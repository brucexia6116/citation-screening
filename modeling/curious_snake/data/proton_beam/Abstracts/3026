A stereotactic radiosurgery technique is described which allows stereotactic radiation therapy to be easily fractionated on a daily or weekly basis. This permits adequate and safe radiation therapy to lesions larger than 2.5 cm, such as large arteriovenous malformations, and possibly safer radiation to smaller lesions near crucial intracranial structures. The technique utilizes external scalp landmarks and avoids the need for standard stereotactic head devices
