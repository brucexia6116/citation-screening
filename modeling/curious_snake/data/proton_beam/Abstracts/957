In vivo dosimetry was implemented for treatments of head and neck cancers in the large fields. Diode and thermoluminescence dosemeter (TLD) measurements were carried out for the linear accelerators of 6 MV photon beams. ESTRO in vivo dosimetry protocols were followed in the determination of midline doses from measurements of entrance and exit doses. Of the fields monitored by diodes, the maximum absolute deviation of measured midline doses from planned target doses was 8%, with the mean value and the standard deviation of -1.0 and 2.7%. If planned target doses were calculated using radiological water equivalent thicknesses rather than patient geometric thicknesses, the maximum absolute deviation dropped to 4%, with the mean and the standard deviation of 0.7 and 1.8%. For in vivo dosimetry monitored by TLDs, the shift in mean dose remained small but the statistical precision became poor
