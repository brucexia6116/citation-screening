The production and rejoining of DNA single-strand and double-strand breaks have been monitored in monolayer cultures of proliferating human skin fibroblasts by means of sensitive techniques. Cells were irradiated with low doses of either 60Co gamma-rays or 14.6 MeV neutrons at 0 degrees C (0-5 Gy for measurement of single-strand breaks by alkaline elution and 0-50 Gy for double-strand breaks measured by neutral elution). The yield of single-strand breaks induced by neutrons was 30 per cent of that produced by the same dose of gamma-rays; whilst in the induction of double-strand breaks neutrons were 1.6 times as effective as gamma-rays. Upon post-irradiation incubation of cells at 37 degrees C, neutron-induced single-strand and double-strand breaks were rejoined with a similar time-course to gamma-induced breaks. Rejoining followed biphasic kinetics; of the single-strand breaks, 50 per cent disappeared within 2 min after gamma-rays and 6-10 min after neutrons. Fifty per cent of the double-strand breaks disappeared within 10 min, after gamma-rays and neutrons. Cells derived from patients suffering from ataxia-telangiectasia showed the same capacity for repair of single- and double-strand breaks induced by 14.6 MeV neutrons, as cells established from normal donors. The comparison of neutrons and gamma-rays in the induction of DNA breaks did not explain the elevated r.b.e. on high LET radiation. However, a study of the variation in the spectrum of lesions induced by different radiation sources will probably contribute to the clarification of the relative importance of other radio products
