The treatment planning approach used within the heavy ion tumour therapy project at GSI Darmstadt includes a biological optimisation, which is based on a biophysical model, the Local Effect Model (LEM). Here we show that the predictions of the LEM are in good agreement with clinical data obtained at the HIMAC in Chiba for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, and the steep dose response for carbon ions is reproduced correctly. This steeper increase corresponds to an increasing RBE with increasing dose, which apparently is in contradiction to the systematics observed in general for in vitro measurements. A possible explanation of this discrepancy is based on the interindividual variation of photon sensitivity
