PURPOSE: Resources for radiation therapy in Vietnam were analyzed to obtain an understanding of the current status of radiation oncological practice in Vietnam. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained through a report on the locations of major equipment and personnel. RESULTS: The availability of both teletherapy and brachytherapy was related to the economic status of the country. Most departments were found to treat patients without simulator or treatment planning systems. CONCLUSIONS: The information in the report is currently available for radiation oncological practices in Vietnam and provides for planning of development programs on radiation oncology.
