The method of calculation of the two- and three-dimensional dose-rate distribution for wedged beams of 9 MV X-rays and Co-60 gamma-rays is presented. The method was examined for Linac Neptune 10p and Gammatron 80S. The experimental results show that for computing the dose-rate distribution of a wedged beam it is sufficient to know: 1. the profile function for open fields defined as the relative dose-rate distribution across the radiation beam and 2. the parameters of the wedge filter. The computed and measured results are presented in tables and on graphs
