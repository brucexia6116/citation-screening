Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the preferential targeting of tumor cells with (10)B and subsequent activation with thermal neutrons to produce a highly localized radiation. In theory, it is possible to selectively irradiate a tumor and the associated infiltrating tumor cells with large single doses of high-LET radiation while sparing the adjacent normal tissues. The mixture of high- and low-LET dose components created in tissue during neutron irradiation complicates the radiobiology of BNCT. Much of the complexity has been unravelled through a combination of preclinical experimentation and clinical dose escalation experience. Over 350 patients have been treated in a number of different facilities worldwide. The accumulated clinical experience has demonstrated that BNCT can be delivered safely but is still defining the limits of normal brain tolerance. Several independent BNCT clinical protocols have demonstrated that BNCT can produce median survivals in patients with glioblastoma that appear to be equivalent to conventional photon therapy. This review describes the individual components and methodologies required for effect BNCT: the boron delivery agents; the analytical techniques; the neutron beams; the dosimetry and radiation biology measurements; and how these components have been integrated into a series of clinical studies. The single greatest weakness of BNCT at the present time is non-uniform delivery of boron into all tumor cells. Future improvements in BNCT effectiveness will come from improved boron delivery agents, improved boron administration protocols, or through combination of BNCT with other modalities.
