A Siemens Mevatron KV2 accelerator installed at the Royal Adelaide Hospital employs cylindrical solid-walled electron cones for some electron collimation. The cones being used at present result in treatment fields that do not always conform with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standards (particularly at high energies). The aim of this project was to simulate the existing cones using Monte Carlo methods in order to evaluate potential cone modifications required to overcome the field irregularities. Simulations were performed using the EGS4 (Electron Gamma Shower version 4, distribution II) Monte Carlo code installed on a DEC Alpha workstation at the University of South Australia. To rigorously simulate the existing electron cones it was necessary to also simulate various components within the treatment head of the linear accelerator. Results of simulations for existing cones were found to be consistent with experimental data. (obtained from Royal Adelaide Hospital beam quality assurance measurements). Two proposed changes to the cones were then simulated and the effects of these alterations were assessed. This study has shown how treatment head simulation techniques can be used to assess the changes in dose distribution that result from alterations to the treatment head and accessories. Within practical engineering constraints modifications to an existing electron collimation system were proposed and theoretically evaluated
