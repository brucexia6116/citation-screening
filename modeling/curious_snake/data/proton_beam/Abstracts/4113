It is proposed to carry out radiotherapy and radiosurgery for brain lesions by crossfiring an array of parallel, closely spaced microbeams of synchrotron-generated x rays several times through an isocentric target, each microbeam in the array having an approximately 25-microns-wide adjustable-height rectangular cross section. The following inferences from the known tissue sparing of 22-MeV deuteron microbeams in the mouse brain and the following exemplary Monte Carlo computations indicate that endothelial cells in the brain that are lethally irradiated by any microbeam in an array of adequately spaced microbeams outside an isocentric target will be replaced by endothelial cells regenerated from microscopically contiguous, minimally irradiated endothelium in intermicrobeam segments of brain vasculature. Endothelial regeneration will prevent necrosis of the nontargeted parenchymal tissue. However, neoplastic and/or nonneoplastic targeted tissues at the isocenter will be so severely depleted of potentially mitotic endothelial and parenchymal cells by multiple overlapping microbeams that necrosis will ensue. The Monte Carlo computations simulate microbeam irradiations of a 16-cm diameter, 16-cm-long cylindrical human head phantom using 50-, 100-, and 150-keV monochromatic x rays
