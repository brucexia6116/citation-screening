Proton radiation, a continuation of radiation oncology's historic search for an optimum dose distribution, offers superior characteristics for clinical radiation therapy. A complete facility for clinical proton radiation therapy has been designed for and constructed at Loma Linda University Medical Center. To bring about this achievement, a consortium of engineers, physicists, and physicians interested in the clinical applications of protons was necessary. The accelerator, the beam transport and delivery systems, the building, and the personnel who operate the system were all brought together to fully exploit the properties of protons for patient treatments, which are now underway
