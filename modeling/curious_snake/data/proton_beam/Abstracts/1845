In this study some chromatographic methods with capillary column, such as GC, GC-MS, GC-FTIR, were used to analyze the products of thymine irradiated by 18O8+ ion beam in N2O saturated aqueous solution. Because of the complexity and small amounts of the products after irradiation by heavy ion beams, it is very difficult to separate them, while with the methods of capillary gas chromatography this problem can be overcome. From the results of GC-MS analysis we can determine the molecular weight of the product, and from the results of GC-FTIR analysis we can get structure information of the product. By this way the products such as 5,6-dihydrothymine, 5-hydroxyl-5-methylhydantoin, 5-hydroxyl-6-hydrothymine, 5-hydro-6-hydroxylthymine, 5-hydroxymethyluracil, trans-thymine glycol, cis-thymine glycol and dimers were determined. Though these products are the same as those from thymine irradiated by gamma ray in N2O saturated aqueous solution, the mechanism of heavy ion beam interact ion with thymine aqueous solution is different from that of gamma ray. The main products from thymine irradiated by 18O8+ ion beam in N2O saturated aqueous solution are formed by hydroxyl additions between 5-6 band of thymine, while those by gamma ray are dimers of thymine
