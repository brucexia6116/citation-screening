We have recently installed a linear accelerator, modified to allow computer control of several machine parameters during irradiation of the patient. As an initial feasibility study of computer-controlled radiation therapy, its application to produce wedge-shaped dose distributions by moving the collimator jaws has been evaluated. The required collimator motions have been calculated with an iterative technique. When these routines were used during irradiations of phantoms containing radiographic film, a good correspondence between calculated and measured dose distributions was observed. It is concluded that computer-controlled motion of the collimator jaws to shape the dose distribution is technically feasible. Additionally, this technique has the advantage that the wedge angle can be continuously adjusted and the isodose curves optimized for a particular depth and field size
