Two experimental methods are described for obtaining average energies of neutron spectra produced by an electron accelerator in a medical treatment room. In the first method, the dose equivalent is measured by means of indium activation foils in an Andersson-Braun moderator. Fluences are determined by the usual activation foil techniques. These data lead to the conversion factor, neutrons/(cm2s) per mrem/h, which uniquely defines the effective energy of the unknown spectrum. In the second method, the fast neutron broad-beam attenuation in polyethylene is obtained from measurement of the thermalized fluence versus depth curve, whose slope in the exponential region parallels that of the fast neutron spectrum. It was found for a 24-MV linear accelerator that the effective energy varied from 0.28 MeV at the isocenter under closed collimators to 0.016-0.024 MeV in the entrance maze. These results compare favorably with other measurements and calculations. It is concluded that the dose equivalent can be measured to within +/- 50% with an activation foil in an Andersson-Braun moderator and that the characteristic energy obtained by attenuation at the isocenter closely approximates the average energy of the neutron spectrum escaping the treatment head
