The purpose of this study was to develop a data set consisting of measures of treatment outcome and cost, capable of standardization across radiation oncology facilities in Australia. Using a detailed consultative process involving representatives of a wide variety of professional organizations including the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists, the study identified the items necessary for inclusion in a data collection instrument to allow assessment of treatment modalities, quality of care, comparative efficiency and cost-effectiveness of radiation oncology services. The instrument has been tested by a pilot study and the results indicate that the items included in the instrument have received acceptance amongst health care providers
