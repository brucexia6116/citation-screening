Using a specially designed program, the authors managed to obtain dose distributions in irradiation by a rotation method in two planes of small intracranial targets with narrow photon beams (up to 1cm) with the energy of 0.2; 1.25; 15MeV. It has been shown that though these distributions less correspond to clinical requirements than those for proton beams the use of narrow photon beams seems promising in this field of radiology
