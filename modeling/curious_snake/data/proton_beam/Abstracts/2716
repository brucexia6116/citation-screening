Prolactin secreting tumors account for ten to twenty percent of all intracranial lesions. The patients harboring these tumors present with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, other ovulatory disorders, infertility, delays in puberty and mixed polyendocrinopathy. These tumors are diagnosed by the measurement of serum prolactin levels, Goldmann-Bowl perimetry, and either computed axial tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Protein secreting tumors are usually benign lesions and historically have been treated by partial or total hypophysectomy or radiation therapy. Surgical resection of the lesion often is followed by recurrence and administration of proton beam radiation therapy results in the development of a panhypopituitary state. Growth of pituitary tumors is controlled with the administration of dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine and prospective studies have suggested that these drugs are now the preferred method of treatment for primary lesions and recurrences.
