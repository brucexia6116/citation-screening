The performance and characteristics of a miniature metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (micro-MOSFET) detector was investigated for its potential application to integral system tests for image-guided radiotherapy. In particular, the position of peak response to a slit of radiation was determined for the three principal axes to define the co-ordinates for the center of the active volume of the detector. This was compared to the radiographically determined center of the micro-MOSFET visible using cone-beam CT. Additionally, the angular sensitivity of the micro-MOSFET was measured. The micro-MOSFETs are clearly visible on the cone-beam CT images, and produce no artifacts. The center of the active volume of the micro-MOSFET aligned with the center of the visible micro-MOSFET on the cone-beam CT images for the x and y axes to within 0.20 mm and 0.15 mm, respectively. In z, the long axis of the detector, the peak response was found to be 0.79 mm from the tip of the visible micro-MOSFET. Repeat experiments verified that the position of the peak response of the micro-MOSFET was reproducible. The micro-MOSFET response for 360 degrees of rotation in the axial plane to the micro-MOSFET was +/-2%, consistent with values quoted by the manufacturer. The location of the active volume of the micro-MOSFETs under investigation can be determined from the centroid of the visible micro-MOSFET on cone-beam CT images. The CT centroid position corresponds closely to the center of the detector response to radiation. The ability to use the cone-beam CT to locate the active volume to within 0.20 mm allows their use in an integral system test for the imaging of and dose delivery to a phantom containing an array of micro-MOSFETs. The small angular sensitivity allows the investigation of noncoplanar beams
