The paper is concerned with some features of the dose distribution of fields of a complex shape in gamma-beam irradiation using gamma-therapeutic units and electron linear accelerators in the complex of combined radiotherapy of patients with endometrial carcinoma. The authors have performed a comparative analysis of calculated and experimental results characterizing dose fields in the utilization of individually selected forming matrices and standard splitting units. It has been shown that the utilization of the forming matrices makes it possible to optimize gamma-beam irradiation with a necessary screening of a primary tumor focus and a preset level of dose exposure in the pelvic lateral parts and zones of regional metastases. Spatial dose distribution with the help of matrices gives an opportunity to use intense intracavitary irradiation with high energy sources using an Agat-B unit
