Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) enhancements and relaxation times of 31P metabolites in human calf were measured in 12 volunteers (4 men and 8 women) at 1.5 T using a dual tuned four-ring birdcage. The NOE enhancements of inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphocreatine (PCr), gamma-, alpha-, and beta-nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) from 19 measurements were 0.51 +/- 0.10, 0.64 +/- 0.03, 0.53 +/- 0.03, 0.56 +/- 0.08, and 0.47 +/- 0.05, respectively. The relaxation times were independent of proton irradiation and from 23 measurements were 3.49 +/- 0.35, 4.97 +/- 0.58, 4.07 +/- 0.36, 2.90 +/- 0.25, and 3.61 +/- 0.25 s for Pi, PCr, gamma-, alpha-, and beta-NTP, respectively. No significant differences between gender and age were observed for either NOE enhancements or relaxation times. Also, among nine volunteers, we observed no significant differences in T1 between the coupled and decoupled cases
