The microdosimetric spectra for high-energy beams of photons and proton, helium, carbon, neon, silicon and iron ions (LET = 0.5-880 keV/microm) were measured with a spherical-walled tissue-equivalent proportional counter at various depths in a plastic phantom. Survival curves for human tumor cells were also obtained under the same conditions. Then the survival curves were compared with those estimated by a microdosimetric model based on the spectra and the biological parameters for each cell line. The estimated alpha terms of the liner-quadratic model with a fixed beta value reproduced the experimental results for cell irradiation for ion beams with LETs of less than 450 keV/microm, except in the region near the distal peak
