Accelerator neutron sources for epithermal neutron capture therapy utilising the 7Li(p,n) nuclear reaction are proposed to operate in the range of 1.88 to 2.5 MeV proton energy. Operation with proton energies closer to the reaction threshold decreases neutron yield but allows for smaller reflector and moderator, with less reduction of the epithermal flux, whereas high energies allow thicker targets to be used. The neutron yields for thick lithium targets are estimated in the energy range of 1.881 MeV to 2.5 MeV and useful neutron flux determined. The optimal range of proton energy is found to be 1.89-1.95 MeV, and this is recommended for more detailed studies of neutron transport properties for accelerator BNCT
