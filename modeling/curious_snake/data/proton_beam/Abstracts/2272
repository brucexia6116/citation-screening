A new total system for radiation therapy installed in our department consists of a linear accelerator unit with microcomputer-controlled multileaf collimators, along with a CT scanner installed in the same treatment room. Also included are a digitally controlled communal couch, a minicomputer, and a system of treatment planning devices. We have developed various kinds of external radiation treatment planning techniques (including dynamic ones) with this system on the basis of the concept of dose corresponding technique. A reference point setup method is needed to maintain a unified coordinate system through each step of the treatment procedure, and, as developed by us, permits a volume-oriented setup. This system has been evaluated for accuracy in a variety of clinical setups. A true three-dimensional dose calculation algorithm is required for treatment planning associated with multileaf collimator treatments in order to realize the potential accuracy of such a system
