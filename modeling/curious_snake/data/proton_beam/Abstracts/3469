Treatment planning for multiarc radiosurgery is an inherently complex three-dimensional dosimetry problem. Characteristics of small-field x-ray beams suggest that major simplification of the dose computation algorithm is possible without significant loss of accuracy compared to calculations based on large-field algorithms. The simplification makes it practical to efficiently implement accurate multiplanar dosimetry calculations on a desktop computer. An algorithm is described that is based on data from fixed-beam tissue-maximum-ratio (TMR) and profile measurements at isocenter. The profile for each fixed beam is scaled geometrically according to distance from the x-ray source. Beam broadening due to scatter is taken into account by a simple formula that interpolates the full width at half maximum (FWHM) between profiles at isocenter at different depths in phantom. TMR and profile data for two representative small-field collimators (10- and 25-mm projected diameter) were obtained by TLD and film measurements in a phantom. The accuracy of the calculational method and the associated computer program were verified by TLD and film measurements of noncoplanar multiarc irradiations from these collimators on a 4-MV linear accelerator. Comparison of film measurements in two orthogonal planes showed close agreement with calculations in the shape of the dose distribution. Maximal separation of measured and calculated 90%, 80%, and 50% isodose curves was less than or equal to 0.5 mm for all planes and collimators. All TLD and film measurements of dose to isocenter agreed with calculations to within 2%
