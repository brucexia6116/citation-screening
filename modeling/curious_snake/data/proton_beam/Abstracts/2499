Germinomas are successfully treated with radiation therapy; we have observed six cases that have been stereotactically irradiated by means of a linear accelerator (radiosurgery). In most cases a single dose of stereotactic irradiation effects the reduction of the tumor volume in a few days. External whole brain and, in two cases, spinal irradiation completed the treatment to avoid seeding of tumor cells. The technique and the advantages of this original therapeutical approach to intracranial germinomas are described and discussed
