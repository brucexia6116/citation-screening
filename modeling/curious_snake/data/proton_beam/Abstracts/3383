In summary, this research has investigated the effects of combined modality treatment (i.e., low linear energy transfer ionizing radiation and hyperthermia at 42.5 degrees C) on the survival responses of two tumour subpopulations (designated clones A and D) obtained from a heterogeneous human colon adenocarcinoma. A constant hyperthermic exposure (2 hours at 42.5 degrees C) was given either 3 min before or 3 min after graded exposure to X-rays. An isobologram analysis (Steel and Peckham 1979) of the clonogenic survival responses of the two tumour subpopulations showed that the clone A responses were within the envelope of additivity for either sequence of application. In contrast, the responses of the clone D tumour subpopulation exhibited a supra-additive response to the combined treatments with the sequence of heat followed by X-irradiation being somewhat more effective than the sequence of X-irradiation followed by heat. These data indicate that the responses of tumour subpopulations obtained from heterogeneous solid tumours to combined modality treatments may vary in an, at present, unpredictable manner
