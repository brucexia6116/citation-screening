This study demonstrates the thermoluminescence (TL) response of CaF2:Tm (commercial name TLD-300) to 30-100 keV protons which were generated by means of a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator. The phenomenon in which the total thermoluminescent output from CaF2:Tm (TLD-300) decreases with proton energy from 30 to 100 keV (with increase of LET) can be interpreted by the track structure theory (TST). The analysis of the glow peaks: P2 (131 degrees C), P3 (153.5 degrees C) and P6 (259 degrees C), of TLD-300 show the oscillatory decreasing phenomenon as a function of incident proton energy, which can be interpreted with the TST and the oscillatory emission of electrons in a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) that is caused by resonant or quasi-resonant charge transfer in ion-atom interactions in this TLD-300
