In-air and in-phantom neutron spectra have been measured between 10 and 60 MeV for two field sizes on the Clatterbridge cyclotron by unfolding the response of a specially built NE213 scintillator. The in-phantom measurements show distinct spectral hardening with depth, which is reflected in changes in the spectrum-averaged mean neutron energy. These findings are confirmed using Monte Carlo calculations
