Dosimetric properties for stereotaxic convergent beam therapy techniques with small field sizes have been investigated as well as for the linear accelerator Mevatron 77 as for the neutron generator KARIN. Additionally we also measured the dose distribution of single plane rotational therapy. As an indication of quality we calculated the V50 ratio as V50 = (F50-F90)/F90 and the corresponding V20 values. For the single plane irradiation there is a considerable difference in dose distribution in favour of photons. V50 (axial) amounts to 1.77 for photons and to 2.7 for neutrons. For the convergential non coplaner arc-therapy using nine plans there is nearly no difference in the high dose region including the 50%-isodose. V50 (axial): 1.16 and 1.6 respectively; (frontal) 1.36 and 1.35 respectively. Regarding to physical dose distributions our results indicate, that 14-MeV neutrons are suitable for high dosed stereotactic single irradiations
