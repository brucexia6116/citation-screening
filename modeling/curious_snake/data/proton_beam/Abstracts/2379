Bragg curves for proton beams are different in shape if measured with different detectors, such as silicon diodes, extrapolation, and thimble chambers. Calculations with an analytic algorithm are presented which show that such differences are caused, at least in part, by the shapes of the detectors. Similar differences must be expected for all beams of heavy charged particles. Dose conversion factors representing the conversion of a measured dose into dose in water are discussed
