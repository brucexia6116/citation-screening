In this study we applied BANG polymer-gel dosimetry using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to densely ionizing radiation such as carbon ion beams. BANG polymer gels were irradiated with a quadratic field of monoenergetic 12C ions at different beam energies in the range of 135 MeV u(-1) to 410 MeV u(-1). They were irradiated at the radiotherapy facility of the GSI, Darmstadt, Germany. Our object was to examine the saturation effect for densely ionizing radiation that occurs at high values of linear energy transfer (LET). The examination yielded the first effectiveness values that will be discussed in the following sections. A solid sphere and a hollow sphere were both irradiated with a horizontal pencil beam from the raster scanning facility at energies of 268 MeV u(-1) (solid sphere) and 304 MeV u(-1) (hollow sphere) respectively. MR dosimetry measurements were compared with data from a planning system. As far as quality is concerned, there is good agreement between the measured dose distributions of both samples and the dose maps from the planning software. The measured MR signals cannot be converted into absolute dose, since the relative efficiency is still unknown for mixed radiation fields of primary carbon ions and it is known only to a limited extent for nuclear fragments with different energies from highly energetic photon radiation. Model calculations are in progress in order to facilitate conversions of measured MR signals into dose
