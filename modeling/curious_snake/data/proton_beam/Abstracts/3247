Surgical intervention was performed in 16 patients with advanced tumors of the accessory sinuses and nose receiving neutron teletherapy. The 1st group (10 persons) was treated by combined therapy including preoperative irradiation with fast neutrons: 2 fractions a week at a dose of 1.2-1.4 Gy, total focal dose of 10 Gy corresponding to an equivalent dose of 40 Gy. Surgical intervention was performed in 10-15 days. In the 1st group during the post-operative period there were no complications, the period of wound healing was not increased as compared to that in the use of routine methods of combined therapy of tumors of the above site. In the 2nd group (6 persons) surgical intervention was performed 2-3 mos. after a radical course of combined neutron-photon therapy. The frequency of postoperative complications was 67%. The period of post-operative wound healing considerably increased
