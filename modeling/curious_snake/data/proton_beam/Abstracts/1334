PURPOSE: To review the state of the art in image-guided precision conformal radiotherapy and to describe how helical tomotherapy compares with the image-guided practices being developed for conventional radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Image guidance is beginning to be the fundamental basis for radiotherapy planning, delivery, and verification. Radiotherapy planning requires more precision in the extension and localization of disease. When greater precision is not possible, conformal avoidance methodology may be indicated whereby the margin of disease extension is generous, except where sensitive normal tissues exist. Radiotherapy delivery requires better precision in the definition of treatment volume, on a daily basis if necessary. Helical tomotherapy has been designed to use CT imaging technology to plan, deliver, and verify that the delivery has been carried out as planned. The image-guided processes of helical tomotherapy that enable this goal are described. RESULTS: Examples of the results of helical tomotherapy processes for image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy are presented. These processes include megavoltage CT acquisition, automated segmentation of CT images, dose reconstruction using the CT image set, deformable registration of CT images, and reoptimization. CONCLUSIONS: Image-guided precision conformal radiotherapy can be used as a tool to treat the tumor yet spare critical structures. Helical tomotherapy has been designed from the ground up as an integrated image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy system and allows new verification processes based on megavoltage CT images to be implemented.
