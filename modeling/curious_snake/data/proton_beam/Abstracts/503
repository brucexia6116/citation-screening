Treatment planning of heavy-ion radiotherapy involves predictive calculation of not only the physical dose but also the biological dose in a patient body. The biological dose is defined as the product of the physical dose and the relative biological effectiveness (RBE). In carbon-ion radiotherapy at National Institute of Radiological Sciences, the RBE value has been defined as the ratio of the 10% survival dose of 200 kVp x-rays to that of the radiation of interest for in vitro human salivary gland tumour cells. In this note, the physical and biological dose distributions of a typical therapeutic carbon-ion beam are calculated using the GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit in comparison with those with the biological dose estimate system based on the one-dimensional beam model currently used in treatment planning. The results differed between the GEANT4 simulation and the one-dimensional beam model, indicating the physical limitations in the beam model. This study demonstrates that the Monte Carlo physics simulation technique can be applied to improve the accuracy of the biological dose distribution in treatment planning of heavy-ion radiotherapy
