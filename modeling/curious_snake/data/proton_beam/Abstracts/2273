A new type of beam-energy monitor is described, which has been developed to check the energies of electron beams from radiotherapy accelerators. The monitor consists of a pair of scintillating fibers and photodiode read-out circuits that measure the energy dependence of electron transmission through a wedge-shaped absorber. A linear energy response and 1% accuracy for energy constancy measurements are attained with the monitor. The monitor having advantages of simple mechanical and electronic constructions, small size, and low cost is suitable for practical use as a portable device
