The same physical principles are the basis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Proton MRS is easily performed with clinical magnets (> or = 1.5 T) and may be added to routine MRI studies to provide metabolic information on pathological tissues. It represents an important tool to detect several metabolic compounds. The article will review the current status of proton MRS with a particular emphasis upon its clinical utility for the diagnosis of brain tumors and for the evaluation of the efficacy of radiotherapy.
