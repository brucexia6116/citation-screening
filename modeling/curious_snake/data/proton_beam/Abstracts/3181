To get the better therapeutic ratio with low LET radiation therapy alone, the improvement of the physical dose distribution and the mode of dose fractionation are required. Since 1972, uneven fractionation irradiation with electron beam has been used for head and neck tumors. The 2 year control rates for primary tongue cancer T1, T2 and T3 by this method were approximately comparable to that of the small source implantation. In the treatment results for the cervical lymph node metastasis, uneven fractionation technique is superior to conventional one. Furthermore, this results was reviewed by means of multivariate analysis
