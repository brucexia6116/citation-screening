The efficiency of radiotherapy of malignant melanoma is discussed according to observations by other clinicians and ourselves. There is no proof that the melanoma is radiotherapy-resistant. The clinical radiosensitivity of human melanoma can be compared with the experimental hamster or mice melanoma or with the sensitivity of cultured melanoma cells. The possibility of increasing the efficiency of radiotherapy in the future by electroaffine sensitizers, fast electrons, or neutrons with a high LET and a small OER is mentioned
