The LET dependence of the response of different glow-peaks of CaF2 : Tm (TLD-300) detectors can be used for separate simultaneous determination of neutron and gamma-ray absorbed doses in mixed neutron-photon radiation fields. The principle the pre-conditions of this "two-peak TLD method" are explained using experimental results with d(14) + Be neutrons (EN = 5,8 MeV)
