Head-scatter factors were measured for a range of field sizes of rectangular shape from a linear accelerator that provides 6 and 25 MV photon beams. For a given field length and width, exchange of the inner and outer collimator pairs produces differences in the head-scatter factor of up to about 2% and 3% in open and wedged fields, respectively. Dependence on elongation deviates by up to 2% from that given by the equivalent squares. Such effects can easily be taken into account by using head-scatter data that have been directly measured in rectangular fields or by applying empirical corrections to values for square or equivalent square fields
