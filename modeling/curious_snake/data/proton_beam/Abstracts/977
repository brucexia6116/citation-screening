More and more attention is being given in radiotherapy to the doses received by organs other than the target organ. With increasing survival time of the patients, the risks of secondary malignancies need to be lowered as much as possible. So total body doses are worth estimating in radiotherapy. The introduction of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) needs an increase in the number of monitor units given to the patient. So there is a risk of increasing the peripheral doses using this technique. Another aspect, mostly neglected, is the neutron peripheral dose that occurs when LINAC energies above 8 MeV are used. We did measurements for both gammas and neutrons with an 18 MV Varian accelerator for a prostate cancer treatment. The measurements were done both free-in-air, at different depths in a plexi-phantom, and using a Rando-Alderson phantom. Effective doses for the total body outside the treatment area are estimated using these measurements
