Nineteen patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) limited to the skin and/or lymph nodes were treated at Hahnemann University with a combination of total skin electron beam and total nodal irradiation (TSEB + TNI). The patients were classified as Stage Ib (1 patient), Stage IIa (8 patients), Stage IIb (5 patients), and Stage IVa (5 patients). Treatment resulted in a complete response in 100% (14/14) of patients with Stage Ib, IIa, and IIb disease, and a CR in 60% (3/5) of patients with Stage IVa disease. The Stage Ib and IIa patients had an overall survival of 100% and a disease-free survival of 44% at 6 years. Four of the five patients with Stage IIb CTCL relapsed within 3 months after completing TSEB + TNI with an overall survival in the group of 40% at 5 years. The Stage IVa patients all relapsed within 7 months and died of their disease within 50 months of completing treatment. The acute effects of TSEB + TNI were well tolerated, but three patients developed second malignancy (lung, kidney and skin) and one patient developed myelodysplasia, possibly the result of radiotherapy
