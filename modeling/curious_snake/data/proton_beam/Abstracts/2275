The first clinical experience of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Computed Tomography (NMR-CT) in Japan is reported here. The first series of patients include 37 with lesions in the brain, 5 in the thorax and 28 in the abdomen. The main advantages of NMR-CT are as follows: No ionizing irradiation exists. Sagittal and frontal tomograms are easily produced. Chemical status of tissue is shown by relaxation times (T1, T2) and proton density. Vascular structures are easily recognized and the blood flow can be estimated. Less bone artifacts are produced compared with X-ray CT. (XCT)
