The manufacture of a series of medical electron accelerators LUEV-15M1 is in line with a tendency to equip radiological units in our country with electron linear accelerators. Clinical and dosimetric characteristics of a linear accelerator of this design that are distinguished by a high penetrating power, a high dose gradient along the beam edge, were studied in the Central Research Roentgeno-Radiological Institute. Its main distinctive feature is an ability to exercise programmed control over a depth dose field in the static and moving irradiation regimens by measuring the dose rate. Computed depth dose fields demonstrated an opportunity to use effectively the accelerator for irradiation of deep foci. Ten patients with head, chest and pelvic tumors were irradiated. Short-term positive results were obtained. Radiation complications hampering radiotherapy, were absent. The shortcomings are as follows: a small rotation angle of the irradiator, small movement rates of the diaphragm blocks and the adjustment of a light field, absence of a functionally fixed shaft. The accelerator has been shown to meet medical and technical requirements
