The two-dimensional FT Imaging of 13C-glucose obtained with twin spin-echo double resonance sequence is presented. The images have been obtained by a doubly tuned surface coil on samples containing water and 13C-enriched glucose in water. It is shown, both theoretically and experimentally, that the whole editing capability of the twin spin-echo double resonance imaging sequence is also preserved in the presence of the radiofrequency field inhomogeneity produced by the surface coil. As in an efficient selective irradiation method, the enhancement in the signal-to-noise ratio with respect to the direct 13C detection, depends on the number of protons J-coupled to 13C
