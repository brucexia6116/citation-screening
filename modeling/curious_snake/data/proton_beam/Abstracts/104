The influence of the electron contamination at in vivo dosimetry with diodes on the patient surface has been investigated by introducing different accessories in the beam path and by changing the field size and SSD. The results show a clear correlation between the electron contamination at an effective measuring depth of the diode and the signal from the patient diode. When the electron contamination is taken into account the agreement between the diode values and the absorbed dose is greatly improved. More accurate in vivo dosimetry with less error margins is therefore possible if better predictions of the electron contamination in high-energy photon beams can be performed
