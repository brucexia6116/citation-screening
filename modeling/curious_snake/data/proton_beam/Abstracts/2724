Sixty patients with pituitary endosellar adenomas irradiated with the proton beam were examined using EEG prior to and following irradiation in the period ranging from 14 days to 3 years. Fourteen days to three months after the proton irradiation, intensified irritation of the diencephalic structures was recorded. Later on, gradual normalization of bioelectrical activity was observed. Local changes in the temporal lobes, probably associated with the tissue response to irradiation by the proton beam were noted only in 8 out of the 60 patients
