Miniature LiF:Mg,Ti (MTS-N) pellets, specially designed for dosimetry in proton radiotherapy, were studied in the 85-550 K temperature range. TL glow curves for differently Mg- or Ti-doped detectors were recorded, showing the preponderant influence of Mg concentration on the intensity of peak 5. The presence of a three-peak complex was also confirmed near 140 K; spectral emission of this peak consists of two bands whose maxima occur at 290 and 420 nm. TSEE glow curves above 300 K similar to those of TL were observed. The behaviour of TSEE and TL peak 5 following an X ray exposure from 33 to 500 Gy was studied: its intensity is a linear function of air kerma in both cases
