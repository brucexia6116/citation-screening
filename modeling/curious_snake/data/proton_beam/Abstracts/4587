The treatment of intraocular melanoma has evolved recently. Enucleation has been superseded largely by brachytherapy, proton beam radiotherapy, stereotactic irradiation, trans-scleral local resection, transretinal resection and diode laser phototherapy. Many patients develop metastatic disease, which usually involves the liver and occurs hematogenously. Disseminated disease rarely responds to therapy, and is usually fatal within 1 year of the onset of symptoms. Uveal melanomas develop characteristic chromosomal abnormalities, such as loss of chromosome 3. This is associated with a reduction in the 5-year survival from approximately 95% to less than 50%.
