Two sets of newly designed large wedge filters for field sizes up to 20 X 20 cm2 have become commercially available for use with 4- and 6-MV linear accelerators. Such field sizes are sometimes required to ensure adequate coverage in certain treatment techniques. This work reports base line data resulting from an investigation of the dosimetric properties of these wedges. Measurements of wedge angles, transmission factors, and beam hardening effects are described, and comparisons are made with the smaller standard wedges
