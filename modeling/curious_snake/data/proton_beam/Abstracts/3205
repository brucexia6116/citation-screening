Knowledge of the angular distribution of an electron beam at the applicator face is a necessary parameter in defining a beam when the Hogstrom pencil beam method of dose calculation is used. The angular spread can be found experimentally using penumbra widths measured at various distances from the applicator face. Using knowledge of the geometry and composition of the scattering foils of the linear accelerator, the angular standard deviation was calculated theoretically using Fermi-Eyges theory. The obtained angular spread values agree with experimentally derived values to within experimental error for electron energies from 6 to 21 MeV. The Fermi-Eyges calculation is fast, and can be used as a quick check to validate experimental angular spread values
