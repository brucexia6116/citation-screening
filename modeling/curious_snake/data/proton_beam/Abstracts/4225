A new method for calculating output factors of asymmetric therapy fields is presented. The method uses the output factors of symmetric fields, as well as off-axis ratios measured in air, to calculate the output factor for an arbitrary asymmetric field. Calculations have been checked by measurements in four photon beams (4-18 MV) of three different linear accelerators. The accuracy between the theory and the measurements is generally better than 1%. According to the preliminary results the method may also be suitable for megavoltage electron beams
