The additional intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and total body irradiation (TBI) to conventional treatment clinical treatment procedures can significantly increase the contribution of accelerator head leakage radiation. Previously recommended procedures by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) for vault design, specifically calculations of primary and secondary barrier thicknesses, are not valid when leakage radiation significantly exceeds direct radiation. Use factor distributions are also influenced by IMRT and TBI procedures. Methods are proposed to extend the NCRP barrier design formulas to resolve these problems. The medical accelerator (weekly) workload is separately determined for the direct, leakage, and scatter radiation components. Applications of the formulas to the calculation of primary and secondary barriers are discussed. The addition of IMRT to the shielding design is explored as a function of the fraction patients receiving IMRT and the MU to dose ratio. Secondary barrier thicknesses could be increased by as much as 1 TVL
