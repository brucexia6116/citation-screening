Radionuclides which decay by the emission of alpha-particles are attractive for certain radioimmunotherapeutic applications. These include the treatment of lymphomas, compartmentally spread malignancies such as ovarian cancer and neoplastic meningitis, and micrometastatic disease. Two alpha-emitting radionuclides of interest for this purpose are 212Bi (60.6 min half life) and 211At (7.2 hr half life). Compared with the beta-emitters commonly used for radiotherapy, the alpha-particles of 212Bi and 211At are of higher energy, much shorter range (less than 100 microm), and considerably higher linear energy transfer. Preliminary results obtained in a variety of in vitro systems and in vivo models have documented the exquisite toxicity of alpha-particles and have established a basis for initiating radiotherapy trials in humans with monoclonal antibodies labeled with alpha-emitting radionuclides.
