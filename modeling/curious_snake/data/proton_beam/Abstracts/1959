Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (hprt) mutations were induced in human TK-6 lymphoblastoid cells by irradiation at a linear energy transfer (LET) of 250 or 310 keV/micron for carbon and neon ions, respectively. At such a high level of LET, ions will lose most of their total energy and stop shortly after passing through the cell. The hprt mutations were analyzed by multiplex PCR, long-PCR and DNA sequencing of both genomic and cDNA. Over half of the C ion-induced hprt mutations (10 of 19) were point mutations, in contrast to 15% of the mutations induced by Ne ions (three of 20). The remaining 47 and 85% of the C and Ne ion-induced mutants, respectively, are deletion events. The latter events include three complex losses of multiple non-contiguous exon regions in both ion irradiation collections. We note that mutations involving the exon 6 region are frequent in the Ne ion collection: all three of the complex events retained the exon 6 region with flanking deletion of sequence and three other mutants involved deletion of this region. It may be concluded that these high-LET C and Ne ion irradiations produce different mutational spectra
