An enhanced dynamic wedge (EDW) is one of the latest technical innovations frequently used in the radiotherapy department. Its usage is enthusiastically supported by radiation therapists. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is the other, which has become popular within the past several years. Its usage is not as straightforward as the EDW. However, its ability to further increase dose conformity to the target and to spare the surrounding normal tissues has been evidenced. Both of these treatment modalities demand sophisticated software, which controls precision motion and speed of jaws or multileaf collimators as well as dose rate. This paper deals with the question of how accurately the EDW profiles and IMRT dose distributions be maintained when the additional constraint of linear accelerator gating is invoked. For this, square pulses mimicking breathing were used in gated and nongated modes for film dosimetry and ion chamber measurements using the Varian 2100C linear accelerator. The results show no observable difference between gated and nongated EDW profiles and IMRT dose distribution regardless of the machine repetition rate. Also studied in this paper are the "fuzzy" dose distributions caused by realistic finite gate window settings
