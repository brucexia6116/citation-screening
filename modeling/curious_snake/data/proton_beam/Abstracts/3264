Biological studies with negative pi mesons (pions) at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) have shown a relatively constant reduction of shoulder of the survival curve for single cell cultures and relatively constant reduction in the no response region for multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) with little change in sensitivity (or slope), in both single dose and fractionated experiments. In clinical studies, a trend toward therapeutic gain for pions has been demonstrated in patients treated at LAMPF, with marked, rapid turmor regression for relatively mild acute normal tissue injury and no untoward effects observed over 7 to 24 months. Since the pion beams used therapeutically at LAMPF are characterized by a small amount of high-linear-energy-transfer (LET) radiation (in the range 10 to 20%), it is hypothesized that pion radiation as compared to x-rays increased the differential tolerance to sublethal injury in favor of normal tissues, resulting in therapeutic gain. It is further proposed that the near simultaneous application of high-LET radiation (such as neutrons) and low-LET radiation (such as x-rays) might create a bilogical situation similar to that of pion treatment, potentially resulting in therapeutic gain, although without the added benefit of dose localization obtainable with pions
