Ten patients with advanced and previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were treated with a synchronous course of radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT). RT consisted of 3600 to 4500 cGy external pelvic treatments on a 6-MeV linear accelerator followed by two intracavitary applications administering a total of 4000 mg hr of radium equivalent cesium. CT consisted of a course of mitomycin C (10 mg/m2 iv bolus) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU; 1000 mg/m2/24 hr for 96 hr) during the second week of external RT and another course of cis-platinum (CDDP; 75 mg/m2, 1-6 hr infusion) and 5FU (1000 mg/m2/24 hr for 96 hr) during the first intracavitary cesium application. Toxicity was acceptable and complete clinical response was obtained in all patients at the end of the regimen. Nine patients are alive (eight without disease) 6 to 37 months following initiation of treatment (median 20 months). One patient has developed lumbar spine bone metastases and another died of local and pulmonary disease at 28 months. This combination of 5FU/mitomycin C/CDDP and RT appears to be a practical, well-tolerated, and highly effective regimen for advanced cervical carcinoma
