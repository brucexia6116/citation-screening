In the present paper the relationship between cell cycle delays induced by Fe-ions of differing LET and the aberration yield observable in human lymphocytes at mitosis was examined. Cells of the same donor were irradiated with 990 MeV/n Fe-ions (LET=155 keV/micrometers), 200 MeV/n Fe-ions (LET=440 keV/micrometers) and X-rays and aberrations were measured in first cycle mitoses harvested at different times after 48-84 h in culture and in prematurely condensed G2-cells (PCCs) collected at 48 h using calyculin A. Analysis of the time-course of chromosomal damage in first cycle metaphases revealed that the aberration frequency was similar after X-ray irradiation, but increased two and seven fold after exposure to 990 and 200 MeV/n Fe-ions, respectively. Consequently, RBEs derived from late sampling times were significantly higher than those obtained at early times. The PCC-data suggest that the delayed entry of heavily damaged cells into mitosis results especially from a prolonged arrest in G2. Preliminary data obtained for 4.1 MeV/n Cr-ions (LET=3160 keV/micrometers) revealed, that these delays are even more pronounced for low energy Fe-like particles. Additionally, for the different radiation qualities, BrdU-labeling indices and apoptotic indices were determined at several time-points. Only the exposure to low energy Fe-like particles affected the entry of lymphocytes into S-phase and generated a significant apoptotic response indicating that under this particular exposure condition a large proportion of heavily damaged cells is rapidly eliminated from the cell population. The significance of this observation for the estimation of the health risk associated with space radiation remains to be elucidated. c2004 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved
