Characterization of narrow beams used in proton stereotactic radiosurgery (PSRS) requires special efforts, since the use of finite size detectors can lead to distortion of the measured dose distributions. Central axis depth doses, lateral profiles and field size dependence factors are the most important beam characteristics to be determined prior to dosimetry calculations and beam modelling for PSRS. In this paper we report recommendations for practical dosimetry techniques which were developed from a comparison of beam characteristics determined with a variety of radiation detectors for 126 and 155 MeV narrow proton beams shaped with 2-30 mm circular brass collimators. These detectors included small-volume ionization chambers, a diamond detector, an Hi-p Si diode, TLD cubes, radiographic and radiochromic films. We found that both types of film are suitable for profile measurements in narrow beams. Good agreement between depth dose distributions measured with ionization chambers, diamond and diode detectors was demonstrated in beams with diameters of 20-30 mm. The diode detector can be used in smaller beams, down to 5 mm diameter. For beams with diameters less than 5 mm, reliable depth dose data may be obtained only with radiochromic film. The tested ionization chambers are appropriate for calibration of beams with diameters of 20-30 mm. TLD cubes and diamond detectors are useful to determine relative dose in beams with diameters of 10-20 mm. Field size factors for smaller beams should be obtained with diode and radiochromic film. We conclude that dosimetry characterization of proton beams down to several millimetres in diameter can be performed using the described procedures
