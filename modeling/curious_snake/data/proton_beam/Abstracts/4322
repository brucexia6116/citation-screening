Since 1973 fractionated proton radiation therapy has been used in the treatment of malignant disease. Protons have favorable physical characteristics that yield dose distributions superior to those of photons in certain clinical situations. As of December 31, 1987, 1,678 patients had been treated. Of these, 110 had chordomas or low-grade chondrosarcomas of the base of skull. The first 68 patients have a minimum follow-up of 17 months. The median dose was 69 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE). (CGE is the dose in proton Gray multiplied by 1.1, which is the relative biological effectiveness for protons relative to 60Cobalt.) The actuarial 5-year local control rate is 82%, and the disease-free survival rate is 76%. Thirteen patients with meningiomas have been treated, following subtotal resection. The median dose was 59.4 CGE. With a median follow-up of 26 months, no patient has had tumor progression. In addition, nine patients with gliomas and 12 with craniopharyngiomas have been treated
