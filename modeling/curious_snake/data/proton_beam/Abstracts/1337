PURPOSE: To introduce and assess a new irradiation technique for lung cancer that utilizes a linear accelerator and computed tomography (CT) scanner combination, along with a novel switching mechanism, which enables patients to synchronize the duration of irradiation with self-breath-holding without respiratory monitoring devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A newly developed treatment unit, a linear accelerator combined with a CT scanner (CT-linac), was used for irradiation. A novel switching mechanism, connected directly to the console of the linear accelerator, enabled the patient to control the radiation beam to correspond with the duration of self-breath-holding during a session determined by a radiation technologist. Twenty patients with lung cancer were enrolled in this study. All patients were instructed in the technique of breath-holding during the inspiration phase using visualization of respiratory motion through fluoroscopy as a teaching aid. CT scans under patients' self-breath-holding were repeated three times, and differences in tumor position on CT images were measured. The reproducibility of tumor position was visually evaluated on electronic portal images (EPI). RESULTS: Mean maximum differences in tumor position under patients' self-breath-holding were 2.2 mm in the cranial-caudal direction, 1.4 mm in the anterior-posterior direction, and 1.3 mm in the right-left direction. Switching of the radiation beam was delayed less than 0.1 s behind patient switching. EPIs were used to determine that reproducibility of tumor position was satisfactorily accurate. CONCLUSIONS: The reproducibility of tumor position, during patient self-breath-holding synchronized with patient-initiated radiation and without a respiratory monitoring device, was sufficiently accurate. This novel irradiation technique for lung tumors using a combination CT-linac offers reduced PTV, sufficient reproducibility, and decreased duration of treatment
