Accurate dosimetry is particularly difficult for low- to medium-energy x-rays as various interaction processes with different dependences on material properties determine the dose distribution in tissue and radiation detectors. Monoenergetic x-rays from synchrotron radiation offer the unique opportunity to study the dose response variation with photon energy of radiation detectors without the compounding effect of the spectral distribution of x-rays from conventional sources. The variation of dose response with photon energies between 10 and 99.6 keV was studied for two TLD materials (LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P), MOSFET semiconductors, radiographic and radiochromic film. The dose response at synchrotron radiation energies was compared with the one for several superficial/orthovoltage radiation qualities (HVL 1.4 mm Al to 4 mm Cu) and megavoltage photons from a medical linear accelerator. A calibrated parallel plate ionization chamber was taken as the reference dosimeter. The variation of response with x-ray energy was modelled using a two-component model that allows determination of the energy for maximum response as well as its magnitude. MOSFET detectors and the radiographic film were found to overrespond to low-energy x-rays by up to a factor of 7 and 12 respectively, while the radiochromic film underestimated the dose by approximately a factor of 2 at 24 keV. The TLDs showed a slight overresponse with LiF:Mg, Cu, P demonstrating better tissue equivalence than LiF:Mg, Ti (maximum deviation from water less than 25%). The results of the present study demonstrate the usefulness of monoenergetic photons for the study of the energy response of radiation detectors. The variations in energy response observed for the MOSFET detectors and GAF chromic film emphasize the need for a correction for individual dosimeters if accurate dosimetry of low- to medium-energy x-rays is attempted
