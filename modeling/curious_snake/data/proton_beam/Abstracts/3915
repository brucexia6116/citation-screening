In a prospective study, accelerated irradiation was performed over 60 portals in 34 tumor patients with peripheral bone metastases. During a period of three days, three daily fractions of 3 Gy each were applied with intervals of four hours, resulting in a total dose of 27 Gy. Using this fractionation schedule introduced by Ammon, a reduction of metastasis-associated pain was achieved in 90% of cases (54/60). The onset of pain reduction was observed earlier than seen with conventional fractionation schedules (five fractions of 2 Gy each per week, total dose 40 Gy). With regard to objective treatment effects, no significant difference was found between accelerated irradiation and conventional fractionation, the rate of remineralization being 43% (26/60), and the rate of stabilization of formerly progressive bone destructions being 55% (33/60). Accelerated irradiation was tolerated well usually. Marked acute side reactions occurred in only one case with metastatic involvement of joint and reaction of synovia. The major advantage of accelerated irradiation is the shortening of the total treatment period and the consequent reduction of treatment stress in patients with advanced cancer
