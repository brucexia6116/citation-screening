Fifteen patients with esophageal carcinoma (superficial, six cases; advanced, nine cases) were treated with 250 MeV proton beam irradiation with or without external x-ray irradiation (12 MV linear accelerator) from October, 1985, to May, 1991. Eleven patients were initially treated with x-ray at doses of 16.2-50.4 (mean 42.5) Gy, followed by proton beam at doses of 30.0-52.9 (mean 37.6) Gy. The other four patients were treated with proton beams alone at total doses of 75.0-88.5 (mean 81.4) Gy. The mean total dose for the 15 patients was 80.4 Gy. As a result, the primary tumor lesions of all 15 patients disappeared and complete responses were obtained. Approximately four to five months later, nine of the 15 patients developed esophageal ulcer formations at the circumferences of their primary lesions. The ulcerations were healed, however, by conservative management. There was no evidence of local recurrence throughout the observations on six cases of superficial carcinoma. Among nine advanced carcinoma patients, three relapsed into esophageal carcinoma. Recurrences were observed eight, 16 and 44 months, respectively, after the treatment. Ten of the 15 patients died, but eight died of other diseases. Three of four cases at autopsy did not show any cancer cells in irradiated primary lesions. Four of the 15 patients lived for over five years. The results suggest that a high dose of irradiation delivered by a well-defined proton field could result in improved local control and long-term survival in esophageal carcinoma without undue risk of injury to primary and adjacent organs
