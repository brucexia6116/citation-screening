Survival was assessed in three groups of disseminated breast cancer with multiple bony metastases. Group I (194 patients) was given a combination of proton irradiation of the pituitary and sequential zone gamma-ray teletherapy of the skeleton, group II (98) received the first component and group III (162 cases)--the latter component of the modality only. Cumulative survival curves for groups I and II were well approximated by exponential function of the follow-up period; mean survival was 36.4 and 11.4 months, respectively. The difference was statistically significant. Within a period of about 12 months, survival curves for groups I and III were nearly identical. However, with the increasing number of bony metastases, the group III curve slope tended to match that of group II. Corresponding mean survival for that segment of the curve was 13 months. Mean survival for historic control was 12.1 months. Thus, pronounced and lasting increase in survival was not observed unless the procedures were used together
