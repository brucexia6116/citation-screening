Dosimetric characteristics of acrylic and stainless steel cones for electron beam therapy were investigated. Acrylic and stainless steel cylindrical cones of 6, 7, and 8 cm in diameter and electron beams of energies 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 MeV were used for the measurements. Both acrylic and stainless steel cones showed high dose areas along the rim. The dose along the rim grew with increasing electron beam energy. The highest dose along the rim was 115% of the maximum dose on a central axis when a 6-cm-diameter acrylic cone and 21-MeV electrons were combined
