We present a review of current technological progress enabling improvement in the quality of stereotactic irradiations: imaging fusion; individual adaptation of dosimetric planning to the shape of the target thanks to several collimation systems, spatial modulation of the beam with the use of multileaf microcollimators, beam intensity modulation, robotisation of the materials, owing to hardware and software developments.
