89 patients with angiographically documented arteriovenous malformations were treated with helium ion Bragg peak radiation. The rate of complete angiographic obliteration 2 years after radiation was 94% in those lesions smaller than 4 cm3 (2.0 cm in diameter), 75% for those 4-25 cm3 and 39% for those larger than 25 cm3 (3.7 cm in diameter); at 3 years after radiation, the corresponding obliteration rates were 100, 95 and 70%. Major clinical complications occurred in 10 patients (8 permanent, 2 transient) between 3 and 21 months after treatment; all were in the initial stage of the protocol (higher radiation doses). 10 patients bled from residual malformation between 4 and 34 months after treatment. Seizures were improved in 63% and headaches in 68% of patients. Excellent or good clinical outcome was achieved in 94% of patients. Compared to the natural history and risks of surgery for these difficult malformations, we consider these results encouraging. Heavy-charged-particle radiation is a valuable therapy for surgically inaccessible symptomatic cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The current procedure has two disadvantages: the prolonged latent period before complete obliteration and the small risk of serious neurological complications
