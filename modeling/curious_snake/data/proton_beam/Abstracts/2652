Dosimetric accuracies at low monitor units are evaluated for linear accelerators from various manufacturers. A large error is observed in the majority of the accelerators. The error can be positive or negative. Although the error can exceed 20% for the first few monitor units, it is usually less than 5% when more than 10 monitor units are delivered. When low doses are required proper precautions should be taken for dosimetric accuracy including the beam energy, beam flatness and dose per monitor unit
