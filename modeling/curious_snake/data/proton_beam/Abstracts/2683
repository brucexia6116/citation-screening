Current methods of linear accelerator workload analysis in radiation oncology use patients per hour or fields per hour as the basic unit of measurement but fail to take account of the variations in complexity of different treatment techniques. The Basic Treatment Equivalent (BTE) model of productivity assessment has been derived as a potentially better measure of workload because it includes a complexity factor. This model has now been tested prospectively in ten radiation oncology departments in New South Wales and compared with the numbers of fields and patients per hour. Over a 4-week period there were 50,115 fields administrated in 18,466 fractions in 441 hours of machine time in ten radiation oncology departments. The average productivity results for all departments were 4.18 patients, 11.25 fields and 5.66 BTE per hour. When compared with patients per hour and fields per hour, there was less variability of BTE per patient per hour in all departments, suggesting that most departments deliver radiation therapy in a consistent way, which is not appropriately reflected in the numbers of fields or patients per hour. Departments that were able to treat a high number of patients or fields per hour were able to do so because they used less complicated techniques or had a less complicated casemix of patients. The BTE model allows for variations in the complexity of treatment techniques, is simple to apply, and is reproducible under different conditions in different departments. Following revision of the model, an Australasian study is now proposed. The confirmation of our findings will have significant implications for resource utilization comparisons, patient time allocations, waiting list estimates and cost-benefit analysis
