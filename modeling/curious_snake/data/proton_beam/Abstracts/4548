In the absence of a predictor of beam output in proton therapy using a broad beam, the beam output is obtained for individual treatments by calibrating the beam monitors. The calibration is carried out under conditions similar to the treatment conditions but with a phantom instead of the patient. However, the dose in the phantom a priori differs from that in the patient. In order to deliver the accurate dose, a correction factor has been introduced to correct the difference. This correction factor is referred to as a scatter factor in an analogy with photon therapy, and is defined as the ratio of the dose at the prescription point in the patient to the dose at the calibration point in the phantom. Under the calibration conditions at Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Center (HIBMC), the range compensator and the collimator, which are usually required in proton therapy with a broad beam, are not used. Therefore the scatter factor includes the effects of the devices as well as the difference between the dose in the patient and that in the phantom. We have developed an estimator using a dose calculation based on the pencil beam algorithm and implemented it in a treatment planning system (TPS) for clinical use. This estimator estimates the scatter factor by calculating the ratio of the doses under the same conditions in the TPS. In order to evaluate the performance of the estimator, demonstrations were carried out for cases with measurable outcomes using a gantry nozzle at HIBMC. We observed 2-3% differences between the measurements and the estimations. These differences were considered to result from the limitations of the dose calculation algorithm in modelling the beam and the patient
