CHO K-1 cells were irradiated during the G1 phase with 0.5-6 rad of alpha particles. There was no appreciable cell killing in this low dose range. Significantly increased frequencies of sister-chromatid exchanges were induced by doses as low as 0.5 rad of alpha-particle irradiation, whereas increased numbers of chromosomal aberrations were observed following exposure to 2 rad. These results suggest that very low doses of alpha radiation may lead to radiation-induced genetic alterations
