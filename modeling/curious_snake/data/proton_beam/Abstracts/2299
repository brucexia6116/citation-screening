Some acromegalic male patients (50%) have weakened sexual function accompanied by a decrease in the levels of LH, FSH and testosterone. Hyperprolactinemia of various degrees was observed in 11 of 13 patients (84%). The summary index SFM (the male sexual formula) and a PRL level showed negative correlation. There was no significant difference in LH response to LH-RH administration between patients with normal and disturbed sexual function. Radiation therapy, in particular proton-beam therapy, produced no negative influence on male sexual function in a long-term period after therapy
