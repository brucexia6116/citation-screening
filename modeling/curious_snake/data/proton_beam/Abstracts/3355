Between 1956 and 1977, the former synchrocyclotron in Uppsala was used for biological experiments and clinical tests with 185-MeV protons. Therapeutic irradiations have been performed since 1957 by cross-firing with pencil beams through small intracranial structures for the treatment of Parkinsonism and intractable pain and with the spread-out Bragg peak for the treatment of large malignant tumors. Radiological and radiophysical aspects of the use of charged-particle beams were studied in detail. The former accelerator is now being converted to a sector-focusing, frequency-modulated cyclotron, SFSC-200, to permit acceleration of protons up to 200 MeV and other light ions to corresponding energies. Production of spallation neutrons and radionuclides for biomedical uses is expected to start this year. Experiments with charged-particle beams will begin in 1986. This paper presents a discussion of accelerator developments for planned experimental and clinical programs
