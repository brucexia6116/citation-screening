Proton therapy offers potentially considerable advantages in the management of slow-growing, poorly resectable or non-resectable tumors resistant to x-rays and located close to critical radiosensitive anatomical structures, such as the brain stem of the spinal cord. Among over 13,000 irradiated patients in the USA, Europe, and Japan, two major clinical indications have been documented: 1. The conservative management of choroidal melanomas, in which 98% 5-year local control can be expected at the price of low toxicity and visual preservation in approximately half of them. 2. The curative management of low-grade chondrosarcomas and chordomas of the base of the skull and cervical spine, leading to, in combination with maximal tumor resection, 84%-94% long-term survival. Other ongoing studies concern prostate, head and neck carcinomas as well as various intracranial tumors. Radiosurgical programs are being conducted generally with single fractions and under stereotactic conditions. [References: 12]
