AIM: The aim of this study was to describe persistence of hypervascularity in proton treated hepatocellular carcinoma at serial follow-up computed tomography (CT). METHODS: Four patients with unresectable solitary hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma underwent 55-82 Gy proton-beam irradiation for a period of 15-47 days. Follow-up CT including plain, enhanced and dynamic imaging was performed for a period of 9-36 months. RESULTS: Good preservation of arterial blood supply while gradual decrease in tumour size was clearly depicted by dynamic CT. CONCLUSION: We believe that preservation of hypervascularity as judged by enhancement at CT and magnetic resonance imaging, does not necessarily mean that radiotherapy in hypervascular malignant tumours has been unsuccessful
