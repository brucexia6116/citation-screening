Since the treatment of the first patient in 1994, the Peacock system has maintained its presence as the dominant method of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery. Currently in use at nearly 80 institutions, over 8000 patients have been treated using the system. Peacock treatments have been delivered to sites throughout the body, including CNS, head & neck, prostate, liver, kidney, lung, mediastinum, and extremities. IMRT, however, is a young and rapidly evolving treatment methodology. As institutions have explored new ways of improving radiation therapy with intensity-modulated techniques, the requirements for the Peacock system have also expanded. More sophisticated planning algorithms have been implemented to satisfy these new requirements, as well as better tools for treatment verification and quality assurance. In addition, new delivery techniques are being examined to improve the ability of IMRT to increase target volume doses while limiting organ-at-risk doses. One such technique, using helical tomotherapy (Peacock is an example of sequential tomotherapy), is currently being evaluated at one institution. Both techniques use narrow, modulated delivery beams. However, helical tomotherapy requires continuous movement of the couch during radiation, similar to helical CT. This work reviews the development of tomotherapy with the Peacock system. It then looks at current IMRT treatment techniques using tomotherapy, and how the field has broadened since the first treatments were delivered. Finally, it looks at the future of tomotherapy techniques, and how these techniques will adapt to the changing requirements for radiation therapy
