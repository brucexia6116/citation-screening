Protons have physical characteristics, which differ from those of photons used in conventional radiotherapy. Better shielding of critical organs is obtained by using their particular ballistic (Bragg peak and lateral narrow penumbra). Some indications as ocular melanoma, chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of skull are now strongly accepted by the radiation oncologist community.
