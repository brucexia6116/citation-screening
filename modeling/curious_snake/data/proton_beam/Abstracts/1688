The treatment schedule for radiation therapy is often interrupted because of complicated skin reactions. Quantitative information relating beam parameters and skin reactions will be helpful. Measurements were performed for 6-15 MV photons and 6-21 MeV electrons with ultra thin TLD films (GR-200F, surface area 0.5 x 0.5cm2, nominal thickness 5 mg cm(-2)). The skin doses for various field sizes, ranging from 10 x 10 to 40 x 40 cm2, and various incident angles of beam from 0 degrees to 80 degrees were measured. The ratios of skin dose to maximum dose in phantom for 10 x 10 cm2 are 16.10+/-0.68%, 14.03+/-1.04% and 10.59+/-0.64% for 6, 10 and 15 MV, respectively. Such ratios increase with a larger field size. For electrons the ratios are 72.59+/-1.72%, 78.52+/-2.99%, 78.89+/-2.86%, 86.08+/-2.62%. 87.75+/-1.94% and 86.33+/-3.09% for 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 MeV, respectively. They also increase with a larger size. The oblique factors also increase with larger incident angle
