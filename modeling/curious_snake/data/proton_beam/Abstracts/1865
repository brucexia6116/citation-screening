The efficacy of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with beta emitters has been clinically demonstrated in the treatment of refractory forms of lymphoma. Alpha-emitting radionuclides with a short half-life are also good potential candidates for RIT directed at tumor targets easily accessible to radioimmunoconjugate molecules and small enough to benefit from the short range of alpha particles (<100 microm). The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of ex vivo purging of multiple myeloma-invaded bone marrow. Tumor cells were targeted by a specific monoclonal antibody (B-B4) coupled to 213Bi by a chelating agent (pentaacetic triamine diethylene p-aminobenzyl acid). The efficacy of alpha-RIT was assessed in vitro by analysis of thymidine incorporation, cell mortality, apoptosis of myeloma cells, and the study of nonspecific irradiation of hematopoietic cell lines not recognized by B-B4-pentaacetic triamine diethylene p-aminobenzyl acid immunoconjugate. High dose-dependent cell mortality of myeloma cells was found with radiolabeled B-B4, and this mortality was total at 30 kBq/10(5) cells. Cells were found in apoptotic state at rates of up to 40% for a dose of 7.4 kBq/10(5) cells. Nonspecific mortality was low compared with specific mortality (up to 1%)
