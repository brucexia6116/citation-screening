Stereotactic radiation therapy with a linear accelerator requires precise alignment of therapeutic radiation distribution to the target volume. To verify the accuracy of alignment, differences between the stereotactic coordinates of the center of the therapeutic radiation distribution determined from portal films and those of the target points determined from CT/MRI or CT/angiographic localization were calculated for 58 points. The average values and one standard deviation were--0.02 +/- 0.50mm, 0.37 +/- 0.39mm and 0.01 +/- 0.25mm in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. The average value of the total deviation was 0.73 +/- 0.07mm. Potential sources of misalignment were misaligned laser pointers, wide laser beam width, improperly zeroed target positioner scale, and motion of the patient couch. The accuracy of alignment should be verified prior to irradiation. Portal film verification is indispensable for strereotactic radiation therapy with a linear accelerator
