Four primary cancers found at autopsy of a patient who received the thorium-based contrast agent Thorotrast 50 years ago and who was healthy up until a few months before his death from liver failure were analyzed for p53 mutations. The data suggest that the chronic alpha-irradiation may be a large causative factor. Multiple mutations were found in all the cancer tissues: two foci of a cholangiocellular carcinoma, a tubular adenocarcinoma of the stomach, a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, and an adenocarcinoma of Vater's ampulla. The total number of point mutations detected were 13. Moreover, homozygous aberrations were detected in a large area of normal small intestine and noncancer liver tissues suggesting that nontumor cells which harbored p53 abnormalities gained a survival advantage and clonally expanded
