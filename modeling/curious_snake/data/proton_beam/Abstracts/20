The proton beam at the Hahn Meitner Institute (HMI) in Berlin will be used for proton therapy of eye melanoma in the near future. As part of the pre-therapeutic studies, Monte Carlo calculations have been performed to investigate the primary fluence distribution of the proton beam including the influence of scattering foils, range shifters, modulator wheels, and collimators. Any material in the beam path will modify the therapeutic beam because of energy loss, multiple scattering, range straggling, and nuclear reactions. The primary fluence information is a pre-requisite for most pencil-beam treatment planning algorithms. The measured beam penumbra has been used as one of the parameters to characterize a proton beam for further calculations in a treatment planning algorithm. However, this phenomenological quantity represents only indirect information about the properties of the proton beam. In this work, an alternative parameterization of the beam exiting the vacuum window of the accelerator, as well as the beam right in front of the patient collimator, is introduced. A beam is fully characterized if one knows (for instance from Monte Carlo simulations) the particle distribution in energy, position, and angle, i.e., the phase space distribution. Therefore, parameters derived from this distribution can provide an alternative input in treatment planning algorithms. In addition, the method of calculation is introduced as a tool to investigate the influence of modifications in the beam delivery system on the behavior of the therapeutic proton beam
