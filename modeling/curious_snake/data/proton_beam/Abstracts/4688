Metastatic tumors are generally considered to be the most common intraocular tumors. These tumors may metastasize from a variety of different primary sites with breast carcinoma being the most common primary malignancy in women and lung cancer being the most common primary malignancy in men. Treatment options for these patients include systemic therapy, conventional external beam radiation, plaque brachytherapy, proton beam irradiation, photodynamic therapy, transpupillary thermotherapy, and laser photocoagulation. Overall, treatment of patients with metastatic tumors to the choroid has proven to be effective in both improving the patient's visual acuity and quality of life. [References: 45]
