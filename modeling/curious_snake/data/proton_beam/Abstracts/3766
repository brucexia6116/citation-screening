Radiation therapy with "heavy" particles offers potential biological and physical advantages compared to irradiation with low LET photons. Clinical studies are in progress with proton beams, which have dosimetric advantages, and fast neutron beams, which have potential biologic advantages. Clinical studies with negative pi mesons and heavy nuclei, which have combined dosimetric and biologic advantages are about to start
