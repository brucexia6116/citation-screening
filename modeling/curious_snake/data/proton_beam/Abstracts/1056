In this work, we investigate a formalism for monitor unit (MU) calculation in Monte Carlo based treatment planning. By relating MU to dose measured under reference calibration conditions (central axis, depth of dose maximum in water, 10 cm x 10 cm field defined at 100 cm source-to-surface distance) our formalism determines the MU required for a treatment plan based on the prescription dose and Monte Carlo calculated dose distribution. Detailed descriptions and formulae are given for various clinical situations including conventional treatments and advanced techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT). Analysis is made of the effects of source modelling, beam modifier simulation and patient dose calculation accuracy, all of which are important factors for absolute dose calculations using Monte Carlo simulations. We have tested the formalism through phantom measurements and the predicted MU values were consistent with measured values to within 2%. The formalism has been used for MU calculation and plan comparison for advanced treatment techniques such as MERT, extracranial stereotactic IMRT, MRI-based treatment planning and intensity-modulated laser-proton therapy studies. It is also used for absolute dose calculations using Monte Carlo simulations for treatment verification, which has become part of our comprehensive IMRT quality assurance programme
