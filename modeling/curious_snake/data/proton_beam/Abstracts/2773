Heavy particles have been used in transcutaneous radiotherapy for almost 50 years. If these particles and pi mesons remain the domain of highly specialized centers, neutron therapy and, to a lesser degree, proton therapy can be considered common clinical protocols; their limits, complications, efficacities and costs are sufficiently well known to encourage several centers to acquire the necessary equipment. Their practical advantages involve a limited number of patients however, for the patients implicated, the prognoses are appreciably improved by the application of these therapies. Hyperthermia-associated radiotherapy is limited by the poor technical capabilities of the currently available hyperthermia machines. If biological experimentation was highly promising, clinical results to date have been unfulfilling. Nonetheless, hyperthermia-associated interstitial radiotherapy represents an interesting clinical possibility. Radiosensitizers are being extensively developed. The results of randomized therapeutic trials are still contradictory and the toxicity of these products renders their use difficult. New products are being tested; their lower toxicity and potent radiosensitization capacity are encouraging for the future use of this class of compounds
