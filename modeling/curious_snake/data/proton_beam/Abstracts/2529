Forty patients with choroidal melanomas received radiation therapy with helium ion-charged particles. Thirty-six of 30 patients either remained stable or demonstrated tumor shrinkage. Seventeen of 18 patients followed up for at least one year after therapy demonstrated tumor regression, with a mean tumor shrinkage of approximately 40%. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear. Charged-particle external-beam irradiation may be more applicable and have less ocular morbidity than either radioactive plaques or photocoagulation
