We report three cases of uveal lymphoid neoplasia that were diagnosed early in their course. One case exhibited a posterior form, presenting with progressive hyperopia from a serous-macular detachment and choroidal involvement along with retrobulbar involvement. This patient was treated with proton beam irradiation. Two cases displayed an anterior form, with fixed fleshy epibulbar masses resembling salmon patches, and choroidal involvement. The histologic findings from biopsy of these anterior masses are presented. One of these patients was treated with complete excision of the mass and double freeze-thaw cryotherapy of the scleral bed, and the other patient was treated with conventional photon beam irradiation. The clinical features of uveal lymphoid neoplasia in its early form are discussed. Evaluation and treatment strategies for these early forms of uveal lymphoid neoplasia are reviewed
