Current radiosurgical techniques allow concentration of radiation from external sources into spherical targets. Nonspherical target volumes require a modification of the irradiation technique. Moreover, isodose shaping is sometimes necessary to spare nearby important radiosensitive structures. To meet these prerequisites we have introduced some technical refinements: (1) computer-controlled rectilinear translations of the target in combination with different angular positions of the source and (2) computer-controlled rotations of the target around a vertical axis in combination with different angular positions of the source. The first solution has proven efficient for treating irregular targets, while the second one was employed for focusing the radiation dose inside volumes obtained by rotation of ellipses
