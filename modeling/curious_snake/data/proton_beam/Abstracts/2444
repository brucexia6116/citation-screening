The dose distributional properties of a p(50) Be neutron beam using a continuously variable multi-leaf collimator are presented and compared with a 6 MV photon beam. The differences in physical dose delivery between these two radiation modalities are generally insignificant for radiation therapy, and stringent comparisons of neutron and photon treatments should therefore be possible. The flexibility in field shaping with the multi-leaf collimator opens new possibilities in the treatment of complex irregular target volumes. The collimator consists of 40 wedge-shaped leaves that are independently moved under computer control with their collimating surfaces always aligned with the effective radiation source to minimize the penumbra. The leaf collimator eliminates the need for handling of heavy insert collimators and beam blocks at the same time that it allows dynamic conformation therapy with neutrons
