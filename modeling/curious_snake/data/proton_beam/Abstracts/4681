In an effort to mimic human in vivo exposures to ionizing irradiation, G(0) phase T lymphocytes from human peripheral blood samples were utilized for in vitro studies of the genotoxic effects of (137)Cs low-LET irradiation and (222)Rn high-LET irradiation. Both types of radiation induced mutations in the HPRT gene in a dose-dependent manner, with a mutant frequency (MF) = 4.28 + 1.34x + 7.51x(2) for (137)Cs (R(2) = 0.95) and MF = 4.81 + 0.67x for (222)Rn (R(2) = 0.51). Post (137)Cs irradiation incubation in the presence of cytosine arabinoside, a reversible inhibitor of DNA repair, caused an increase in the MF over irradiation alone, consistent with a misrepair mechanism being involved in the mutagenicity of low-LET irradiation. The spectrum of (137)Cs irradiation-induced mutation displayed an increase in macro-deletions (in particular total gene deletions) and rearrangement events, some of which were further defined by either chromosome painting or direct DNA sequencing. The spectrum of (222)Rn irradiation-induced mutation was characterized by an increase in small alterations, especially multiple single base deletions/substitutions and micro-deletions. These studies define the specific response of human peripheral blood T cells to ionizing irradiation in vitro and form a basis for evaluating the genotoxic effects of human in vivo exposure
