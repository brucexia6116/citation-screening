The moving-strip irradiation of the total peritoneal region plays an important role in the adjuvant therapy of the ovarian carcinoma. TLD dosimetric and mathematic investigations of this radiotherapeutic method show that 1. the best dose homogeneity in the longitudinal profile is achieved by 60Co units, if the patients are not too stout, 2. a higher relative depth dose has to be estimated than for an open field of the same total field size, 3. an additional 2,5 cm strip has to be inserted in order to achieve an abrupt drop on the border of the total irradiation field, 4. this method offers a good guarantee against false adjustment, if this is not too grave, 5. the conformity between the dose distribution curves calculated and those measured by TLD is excellent
