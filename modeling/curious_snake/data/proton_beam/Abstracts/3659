Early local radiation reactions and radiation damage during fast neutron therapy of head and neck tumors were studied. The frequency of moist epidermitis in a radical course of neutron therapy was 33%, that in combined neutron and photon irradiation was 21%. Mucosal reactions were observed in 30-35% of the patients with tumors of the oral mucosa. The most frequent radiation damage in a long-term period were fibrotic changes of the skin and subcutaneous connective tissue
