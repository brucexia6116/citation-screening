PURPOSE: To investigate the treatment outcome of patients suffering from skull base chordoma or chondrosarcoma after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We report 45 patients treated for chordoma or chondrosarcoma with postoperative fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy between 1990 and 1997. Patients had CT and MRI for 3D treatment planning performed under stereotactic guidance. Median dose at isocenter was 66.6 Gy for chordomas and 64.9 Gy for chondrosarcomas. MRI imaging was obtained in intervals after therapy to evaluate local relapse. Survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: All chondrosarcomas had achieved and maintained local control and recurrence-free status at follow-up of 5 years. Local control rate of chordomas was 82% at 2 years and 50% at 5 years. Survival was 97% at 2 years and 82% at 5 years. At maximum follow-up of 8 years local control and survival rate of chordomas was 40% (82%). Clinically significant late toxicity developed in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of fractionated photon beam therapy and its success in the treatment of skull base tumors. Modern 3D treatment techniques provide superior results compared to conventional techniques. The role of high-precision radiotherapy compared to particle beam therapy in the treatment of these tumors is not yet fully clear and further research is needed
