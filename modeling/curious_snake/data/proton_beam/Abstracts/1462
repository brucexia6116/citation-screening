Magnetization transfer (MT) was measured in the parotid gland in vivo by (1)H MR spectroscopy in 10 adult volunteers. A comparison was made of stimulated (excess saliva) and resting parotid gland (SPG and RPG, respectively). Following irradiation at an MT pulse of 150 Hz downfield from the water proton signal, signal reductions in SPG and RPG were 83.8 +/- 4.7 and 91.4 +/- 5.7%, respectively. The larger reduction for SPG indicates that an increase in the amount of water in gland cells for the production of more parotid saliva may lead to greater affinity between the protons adjacent to macromolecules and free water which contributes to the MT effect. Activity in the parotid gland correlates with the effect. This method is useful for diagnosing disorders of parotid gland secretion. Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd
