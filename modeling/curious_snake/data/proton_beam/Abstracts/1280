PURPOSE: To assess whether laser-induced hyperthermia with proton irradiation of choroidal melanoma may decrease exudative retinal detachments more rapidly. DESIGN: Case control study. METHODS: Patients treated with laser-induced hyperthermia and proton radiation; results were compared with similar patients treated with only protons. RESULTS: All 11 patients treated with combined laser and proton therapy had resorption of subretinal fluid with a mean duration of retinal detachment of 193 days compared with 263 days in the group treated with only proton therapy (P <.04). At 1 year, visual acuity was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Combined laser radiation more rapidly dissipates exudative detachments than radiation alone
