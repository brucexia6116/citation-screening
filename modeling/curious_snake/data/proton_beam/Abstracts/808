Accurate measurements of the penumbra region are important for the proper modeling of the radiation beam for linear accelerator-based intensity modulated radiation therapy. The usual data collection technique with a standard ionization chamber artificially broadens the measured beam penumbrae due to volume effects. The larger the chamber, the greater is the spurious increase in penumbra width. This leads to inaccuracies in dose calculations of small fields, including small fields or beam segments used in IMRT. This source of error can be rectified by the use of film dosimetry for penumbra measurements because of its high spatial resolution. The accuracy of IMRT calculations with a pencil beam convolution model in a commercial treatment planning system was examined using commissioning data with and without the benefit of film dosimetry of the beam penumbrae. A set of dose-spread kernels of the pencil beam model was calculated based on commissioning data that included beam profiles gathered with a 0.6-cm-i.d. ionization chamber. A second set of dose-spread kernels was calculated using the same commissioning data with the exception of the penumbrae, which were measured with radiographic film. The average decrease in the measured width of the 80%-20% penumbrae of various square fields of size 3-40 cm, at 5 cm depth in water-equivalent plastic was 0.27 cm. Calculations using the pencil beam model after it was re-commissioned using film dosimetry of the penumbrae gave better agreement with measurements of IMRT fields, including superior reproduction of high dose gradient regions and dose extrema. These results show that accurately measuring the beam penumbrae improves the accuracy of the dose distributions predicted by the treatment planning system and thus is important when commissioning beam models used for IMRT
