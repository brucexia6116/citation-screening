The Therac 20 medical linear accelerator produces electron beams of 6, 9, 13, 17, and 20 MeV. We measured depth dose, isodose curves, and output factors for small electron fields using an ionization chamber, film, and thermoluminescent dosimeters. Tables and graphs were generated from these measurements for accurate treatment planning of various blocked and open fields
