Using X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy at liquid helium temperatures, the Cu(II) coordination geometry at the active site of bovine and human copper,zinc-superoxide dismutases (bSOD1 and hSOD1) treated with H(2)O(2) and bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) was examined. The time course EPR of wild type human SOD1 (WT hSOD1), W32F hSOD1 mutant (tryptophan 32 substituted with phenylalanine), and bSOD1 treated with H(2)O(2) and HCO(3)(-) shows an initial reduction of active site Cu(II) to Cu(I) followed by its oxidation back to Cu(II) in the presence of H(2)O(2). However, HCO(3)(-) induced a Trp-32-derived radical from WT hSOD1 but not from bSOD1. The mutation of Trp-32 by phenylalanine totally eliminated the Trp-32 radical signal generated from W32F hSOD1 treated with HCO(3)(-) and H(2)O(2). Further characterization of the free radical was performed by UV irradiation of WT hSOD1 and bSOD1 that generated tryptophanyl and tyrosyl radicals. Both proton ((1)H) and nitrogen ((14)N) ENDOR studies of bSOD1 and hSOD1 in the presence of H(2)O(2) revealed a change in the geometry of His-46 (or His-44) and His-48 (or His-46) coordinated to Cu(II) at the active site of WT hSOD1 and bSOD1, respectively. However, in the presence of HCO(3)(-) and H(2)O(2), both (1)H and (14)N ENDOR spectra were almost identical to those derived from native bSOD1. We conclude that HCO(3)(-)-derived oxidant does not alter significantly the Cu(II) active site geometry and histidine coordination to Cu(II) in SOD1 as does H(2)O(2) alone; however, the oxidant derived from HCO(3)(-) (i.e. carbonate anion radical) reacts with surface-associated Trp-32 in hSOD1 to form the corresponding radical
