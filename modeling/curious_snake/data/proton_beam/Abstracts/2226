Irradiation of human G0 lymphocytes with plutonium-238 alpha-particles and X-rays was performed to investigate the production of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE). Alpha-particles produce a significant increase in SCE and this elevation is more significant when separated lymphocytes are irradiated. X-ray irradiation did not induce any significant increase in SCE. Therefore the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for the induction of SCE by alpha-particles in this system is undefined and effectively infinite
