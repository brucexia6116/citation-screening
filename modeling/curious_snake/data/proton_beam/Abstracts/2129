There are a number of models, both analytical and Monte Carlo, which are used to describe the fluence from the treatment head of accelerators. One common problem in these simulations is to find relevant information about details in the treatment head. A complex unit in the treatment head for which reliable data is seldom given is the monitor chamber. In this work two methods are described for obtaining this information by analyzing the increased scattering of an electron beam when the monitor chamber is introduced in the beam. It was found that the effective thickness of the electrodes in a monitor chamber can be determined with sufficient accuracy by using experimental results combined with Fermi-Eyges theory or Monte Carlo simulations
