A study of three 10-MV x-ray clinical accelerators with emphasis on the reduction of electron contamination was conducted. This study, which was performed with different types of trays and filters, suggests that, at 100-cm source-surface distance (SSD), Pb can be used as an effective filter material up to 30 X 30 cm2; however, due to its transparency, a Clear-Pb tray is useful for field sizes up to a 20 X 20 cm2. Percent depth doses for a few selected depths and field sizes at this nominal SSD were examined. No significant differences, with the exception of the location of Dmax, amongst the three accelerators were noticed
