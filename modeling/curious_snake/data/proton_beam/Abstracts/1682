Air has been irradiated with high energy protons at the 12 GeV proton synchrotron to obtain the following parameters essential for the internal dose evaluation from airborne 11C produced through nuclear spallation reactions: the abundance of gaseous and particulate 11C, chemical forms, and particle size distribution. It was found that more than 98% of 11C is present as gas and the rest is aerosol. The gaseous components were only 11CO and 11CO2, and their proportions were approximately 80% and 20%, respectively. The particulate 11C was found to be sulphate and/or nitrate aerosols having a log-normal size distribution; the measurement using a diffusion battery showed a geometric mean radius of 0.035 micron and a geometric standard deviation of 1.8 at a beam intensity of 6.8 x 10(11) proton.pulse-1 and an irradiation time of 9.6 min. By taking the chemical composition and particle size into account, effective doses both from internal and from external exposures per unit concentration of 11C were calculated for various room sizes. The values can be used to evaluate the effective dose from the airborne 11C produced in the accelerator tunnels
