OBJECTIVE: For patients in whom acromegaly persists despite pituitary surgery or drug treatment, gamma-knife surgery represents an additional treatment option. Considering carefully the different reported biochemical outcomes, the central point is whether gamma-knife radiosurgery has advantages compared to conventional radiotherapy or, furthermore, to newer medical therapies, such as long-acting somatostatin analogues or growth hormone receptor antagonists. DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the outcome of 44 patients with acromegaly, who received gamma-knife surgery with the Leksell gamma knife. The median follow-up time was 1.9 years (0.5-4.3 years) post-radiosurgery. 43 of 44 patients had previously undergone pituitary surgery. RESULTS: Immediately prior to gamma-knife surgery, median xULN of patients' serum IGF-I was 1.9 times above upper limit of normal (range: 0.5-8.9 xULN [multiple of upper limit of normal range]). There was a significant decline of serum IGF-I at patients' final follow-up. We found a normal age-adjusted IGF-I in 21/44 patients (xULN of IGF-I<1). Furthermore, as the number of treated patients increased, we found an improvement in remission rate, which let us assume that there was a learning effect for the gamma-knife performing team over time. In addition, the median adenoma size decreased from 1.5 ml (0.1-6.9 ml) prior to gamma-knife therapy to 0.3 ml (no rest vol. detectable-2.4 ml) at patients' last visit. CONCLUSION: We have shown that pituitary gamma-knife surgery is effective in lowering serum IGF-I levels. At the end of the follow-up period, 48 % of our cohort had normal age-adjusted IGF-I levels
