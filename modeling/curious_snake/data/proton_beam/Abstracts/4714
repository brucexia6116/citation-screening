Proton radiation therapy has been used at Loma Linda University Medical Center for 15 years, sometimes in combination with photon irradiation, surgery, and chemotherapy, but often as the sole modality. Our initial experience was based on established studies showing the utility of protons for certain management problems, but since then we have engaged in a planned program to exploit the capabilities of proton radiation and expand its applications in accordance with progressively accumulating clinical data. Our cumulative experience has confirmed that protons are a superb tool for delivering conformal radiation treatments, enabling delivery of effective doses of radiation and sparing normal tissues from radiation exposure.
