In agreement with the EORTC Charged Particle Therapy Project Group, a pilot phase of neutron treatment was performed on 59 patients in 1978. All patients suffered from far-advanced tumours. Sixteen were treated with neutrons exclusively, while all the others had recurrences after chemotherapy, surgery, or combined surgery and photon- or electron therapy. 29 of them received reduced doses (10 to 14 Gy), thirty patients got a full neutron course of 16 Gy (Total Effective Dose). The observation time varied from 2 to 11 months. Serious side effects occurred in 11 cases. A complete tumour regression was achieved in 35 patients, and a partial regression in 17. Recurrences developed in 5 cases, no tumour regression was seen in 2 cases. These preliminary results encouraged us to start a randomized trial of head and neck tumours according to the protocols of the EORTC Charged Particle Therapy Project Group
