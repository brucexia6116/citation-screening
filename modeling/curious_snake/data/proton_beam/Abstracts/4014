Recent developments in computer technology enable the use of direct measured data without complex calculations for the isodose generation of electron fields of a 42 MeV Betatron. To reduce the time necessary for measuring the isodose data, different procedures to measure and generate electron matrices are investigated. Different methods to reduce the amount of data necessary for the isodose-generation are introduced. Under certain circumstances isodose data for numerous field sizes can be generated from a set of data of one field with sufficient accuracy
