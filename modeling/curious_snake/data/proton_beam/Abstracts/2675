The palliation of bone pain is a common clinical problem once metastatic prostate cancer has escaped from hormonal control. This retrospective study compares the results of treatment using hemibody irradiation (HBI) at the Royal Marsden Hospital (27 cases) with isotope therapy using the bone-seeking isotope strontium-89 (89Sr) at Southampton General Hospital (51 cases). Prior to analysis patients were matched for potential prognostic factors (performance status, bone scan extent of disease, age, histology and duration of hormone response) to minimize the effect of treatment selection bias. Pain control assessed at 3 months was similar for HBI and matched 89Sr cases, with 63% and 52% respectively showing some benefit. Median survival was similar for these groups at 20 and 21 weeks respectively. The unmatched 89Sr group, which had more favourable prognostic factors, had a better outcome with 96% showing improvement in pain and with a median survival of 59 weeks. Subsequent univariate analysis demonstrated that performance status and extent of disease on bone scan were of overriding importance in determining outcome. Transfusion requirements were higher for the HBI group than for the matched 89Sr group (50% and 25% respectively) but other bone marrow toxicity was similar. Despite routine anti-emetic therapy 37% of patients treated with HBI had some nausea or vomiting. Although expensive, 89Sr appears as effective a treatment option as HBI. Response is most likely with either approach when patients have a good performance status and a limited extent of disease. [References: 32]
