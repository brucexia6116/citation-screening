There are two basic approaches to the appropriate therapy for carcinoma of the anterior commissure. The dilemma of whether to treat by primary irradiation or by conservative surgery is not yet solved. In this study, 67 patients were treated between 1967 and 1987 for anterior commissure carcinoma of the larynx. Radiation was used with 47 patients and conservation surgery with 20 patients. Initial lesion control was achieved with 72% of the patients treated by primary irradiation. Conservation surgery, when used as a primary treatment modality, achieved local control in 90% of the patients. The new techniques of reconstruction of the larynx enhance the surgeon's ability, strengthen his conviction to proceed to enlarged partial laryngectomies, and thus improve the oncologic control of the anterior commissure carcinoma as well
