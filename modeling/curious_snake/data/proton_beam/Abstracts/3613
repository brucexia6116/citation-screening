For accurate three-dimensional treatment planning, new models of dose calculations are being developed which require the knowledge of the energy spectra and angular distributions of the photons incident on the surface of the patient. Knowledge of the spectra is also useful in other applications, including the design of filters and beam modifying devices and determination of factors to convert ionization chamber measurements to dose. We have used Monte Carlo code (EGS) to compute photon spectra for a number of different linear accelerators. Both the target and the flattening filter have been accurately modeled. We find the mean photon energy to have a value lower than the generally perceived value of one-third the maximum energy. As expected, the spectra become softer as the distance from the central axis increases. Verification of the spectra is performed by computing dose distributions and half-value layers in water using the calculated spectra and comparing the results with measured data. We also examined the angular distributions of photons incident on the surface of the phantom. In currently used models of dose computations, it is assumed that the angular distribution of photons with respect to fan lines emanating from the source is negligible. Although the angular spread of photons with respect to the incident direction has been found to be small, its contribution to the diffuseness of the beam boundaries is significant
