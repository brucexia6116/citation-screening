Proton therapy is increasingly used in medical treatments for cancer patients due to the sharp dose conformity offered by the characteristic Bragg peak. Proton beam interactions with the eye will be simulated using the MCNPX Monte Carlo code and available nuclear cross-section data to calculate the dose distribution in the eye gel and surrounding organs. A high-resolution eye model will be employed using a 3D geometrical voxel-based anthropomorphic head phantom obtained from the Visible Human Project (female data). Manual segmentation of the eye, carried out by the Medical Physics group at the University of Surrey resulted in 15 identified structures. This work emphasizes the use of a realistic phantom for accurately predicting dose deposition by protons
