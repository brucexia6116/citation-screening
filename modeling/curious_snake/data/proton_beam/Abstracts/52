In this study, human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) vesicles were irradiated with 73 MeV protons (LET of 1 keV/microm) and 11.4 MeV/nucleon argon ions (LET of 1.52 MeV/pm) and the effectiveness of charged particles in initiating peroxidation of LDLs was investigated. The LDL suspension (6 g/l) was exposed to protons and to argon ions in a dose range of 24 Gy to 2.4 kGy. Irradiations were carried out at the synchrocyclotron at the CPO and at the UNILAC of the GSI. After irradiation three chemical assays were used to study the progression of peroxidation of LDLs: the formation of conjugated dienes, the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and the increase in the relative electrophoretic mobility of the LDLs. The results were compared with those obtained after gamma irradiation. For protons the yields of the peroxidation products were 10 times lower than after gamma irradiation. However, for doses below 200 Gy, protons appeared to be more effective than gamma rays in damaging the protein moiety, as deduced from the observed increase in the relative electrophoretic mobility of the LDLs. The irradiation with argon ions led to a negligible formation of peroxidation products, but an increase in the relative electrophoretic mobility of the LDLs was observed. The results are indicative of a lower yield of lipid peroxidation after irradiation with high-LET particles. In contrast, protons and argon ions appear to be more effective in inducing bulk protein and phospholipid damage than gamma rays
