The advantages of particle-beam radiation therapy include its radiobiologic properties and spatial dose distribution. With the recent progress in diagnostic imaging, the cumulative knowledge of radiation biology, and the development of a 3-dimensional treatment planning system, particle-beam radiation therapy could prove clinically effective. Local control of tumors is an essential for the cure. Particle-beam radiation therapy has the potential to provide better local tumor control. [References: 25]
