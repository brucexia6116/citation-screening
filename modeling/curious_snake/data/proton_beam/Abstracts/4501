Neutron sources created by 4-, 3.5-, and 3-MeV protons striking a thick beryllium target were studied via the time-of-flight technique. Protons were accelerated by the Peking University 4.5 MV electrostatic accelerator. Two disk-shaped 9Be targets with thickness 1.5 and 3 mm were used in the measurements. The time-of-flight spectra were observed at zero degrees with respect to the incident proton beam. The analysis to these time-of-flight spectra is given. The time-of-flight spectra were converted to the energy spectra and compared to a neutron spectrum of 7Li(p, n)7 Be reaction with incident energy 2.5 MeV, which was also measured in this work. Restricted by the spectrometer itself, the threshold of the measurements is 400 keV. The results show that by using several MeV protons bombarding a thick beryllium target, reactions other than 9Be(p, n)9B produce significant contributions to the neutron yield with energy less than 1 MeV
