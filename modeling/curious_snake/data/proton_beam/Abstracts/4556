Absorbed photoneutron dose to patients undergoing 18 MV x-ray therapy was studied using Monte Carlo simulations based on the MCNPX code. Two separate transport simulations were conducted, one for the photoneutron contribution and another for neutron capture gamma rays. The phantom model used was of a female patient receiving a four-field pelvic box treatment. Photoneutron doses were determinate to be higher for organs and tissues located inside the treatment field, especially those closest to the patient's skin. The maximum organ equivalent dose per x-ray treatment dose achieved within each treatment port was 719 microSv/Gy to the rectum (180 degrees field), 190 microSv/Gy to the intestine wall (0 degrees field), 51 microSv/Gy to the colon wall (90 degrees field), and 45 microSv/Gy to the skin (270 degrees field). The maximum neutron equivalent dose per x-ray treatment dose received by organs outside the treatment field was 65 microSv/Gy to the skin in the antero-posterior field. A mean value of 5 +/- 2 microSv/Gy was obtained for organs distant from the treatment field. Distant organ neutron equivalent doses are all of the same order of magnitude and constitute a good estimate of deep organ neutron equivalent doses. Using the risk assessment method of the ICRP-60 report, the greatest likelihood of fatal secondary cancer for a 70 Gy dose is estimated to be 0.02% for the pelvic postero-anterior field, the rectum being the organ representing the maximum contribution of 0.011%
