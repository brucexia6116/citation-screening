Twenty-eight patients with very advanced lung cancer were treated with 500 rad once weekly to a total dose of 6000 rad (2050 ret). Twenty-one of the 28 patients (75%) achieved at least a partial local response. There were 9 patients (32%) who achieved a complete response and 12 patients (43%) who achieved a partial response. The responses were 9/11 for squamous cell carcinoma, 5/10 for adenocarcinoma, 5/5 for large cell carcinoma, and 2/2 for small cell carcinoma patients. Treatment was very well tolerated and in fact, no acute radiation related complications were observed during the 10-12 week treatment duration. Radiation induced fibrosis of various degrees has occurred but it has been mostly asymptomatic and similar to what is normally seen using conventional continuous schedules. In this group of very advanced lung cancer patients, failures have mostly resulted from metastatic progression; only one patient progressed locally in the irradiated field without evidence of metastatic disease. A preliminary analysis indicates that this treatment yields results that are similar to those achieved with conventional fractionation regimens and should be explored further
