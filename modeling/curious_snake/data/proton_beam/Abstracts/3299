The authors presented some experimental and theoretical data on dose distribution in a tissue equivalent phantom during irradiation with electrons at 8; 10; 12.5; 15 and 17.5 MeV. The proposed mathematical apparatus based on the method of dose functions of a punctate unidirectional source, can be used for the development of programs of dosimetric planning of electron therapy using the LUEV-15MI accelerator
