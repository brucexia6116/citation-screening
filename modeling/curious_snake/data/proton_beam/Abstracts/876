Radiation-induced damage to living cells results from either a direct hit to cellular DNA, or from indirect action which leads to DNA damage from radiation produced radicals. However, in recent years there is evidence that biological effects such as cell killing, mutation induction, chromosomal damage and modification of gene expression can occur in a cell population exposed to low doses of alpha particles. In fact these doses are so low that not all cells in the population will be hit directly by the radiation. Using a precision alpha-particle microbeam, it has been recently demonstrated that irradiated target cells can induce a bystander mutagenic response in neighboring "bystander" cells which were not directly hit by alpha particles. Furthermore, these results suggest that gap-junction mediated cell-to-cell communication plays a critical role in this bystander phenomenon. The purpose of this section is to describe recent studies on bystander biological effects. The recent work described here utilized heavy charged particles for irradiation, and investigated the role of gap-junction mediated cell-cell communication in this phenomenon. [References: 21]
