Treatment with several doses per day offers the prospect of a significant therapeutic gain using readily available low LET beams. These regimens can be classified as either accelerated fractionation or hyperfractionation according to their rationales. With accelerated fractionation a conventional number of dose fractions is delivered in a significantly shortened overall treatment time in order to reduce the opportunity for tumor cell regeneration during treatment. With hyperfractionation, on the other hand, a large number of significantly reduced dose fractions is used to give a greater total dose in a conventional overall treatment time. The rationale for this strategy is threefold: 1) increased opportunity for tumor cell redistribution and reoxygenation between dose fractions: 2) a possibly lower oxygen enhancement ratio with small incremental doses; and 3) different sparing of late reacting normal tissues with small dose fractions. A review of the published clinical experience with multiple fractions per day treatment reveals few studies of either pure accelerated fractionation or hyperfractionation since both are limited by acute normal tissue reactions. This has led to a variety of hybrid regimens, some of which have no clear rationale. The choice between accelerated fractionation and hyperfractionation is determined by the regenerative capability of tumor clonogens during treatment. A method of selection based on potential doubling times is presented
