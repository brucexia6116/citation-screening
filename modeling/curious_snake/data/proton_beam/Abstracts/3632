In recent years, there have been several advances in blood irradiation practice. These include a better definition of the most appropriate dose level that should be used when irradiating blood components. Commercial innovation has provided the tools for a quality assurance program to assess the dose that is delivered throughout the canister in a free-standing irradiator, and, through the use of radiation-sensitive indicator labels, to confirm that the irradiation process has taken place. With the apparent increased use of linear-accelerators to irradiate blood components, appropriate quality assurance measures need to be developed. The maximum storage period for irradiated red cells should be shorter than for nonirradiated red cells if the treatment is performed early during the storage period because irradiation reduces the in vivo 24-hour red cell recovery parameter. The storage period for irradiated platelets does not need to be modified. Some questions are being raised regarding whether fresh-frozen plasma should be irradiated to inactivate a small number of immunocompetent progenitor cells that may be present. Table 4 summarizes the practices that should be followed in connection with the technical issues that have been addressed in this article. These guidelines follow the recommendations issued in July 1993 by the FDA in the United States. This article and Tables 1 and 2 contain additional guidelines. [References: 59]
