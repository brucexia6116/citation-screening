Finding the actual zero degree of the gantry angle is important in order to perform the mechanical quality assurance (QA) of linear accelerators. To determine real zero, we must locate a "good surface" which could be defined as a plane on the surface of the gantry head that is perpendicular to the direction of radiation. The actual gantry angle could then be defined as the angle between vertical, as indicated by a plumb bob, and the direction of the beam axis that could be indicated by the position of a BB placed in the central axis and its shadow. From this we located the real zero degree and the good surface. The good surface can be applied to check the important mechanical readouts. The technique we introduce could solve the essential problems of a traditional QA technique, as well as taking up an important role in the quality assurance of a patient's treatment
