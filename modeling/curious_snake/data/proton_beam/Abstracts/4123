From December 1986 through December 1988, 33 patients with inoperable arteriovenous malformation (AVM) were treated in our center with the dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery, which uses a standard 10 MV isocentric linear accelerator. There were 18 females and 15 males with a median age of 26 years (range: 9-69) and a median follow-up time of 16 months (range: 7-32). The arteriovenous malformation volumes treated ranged from 0.2 to 42 cm3. The prescribed doses at the isocenter varied from 50 to 55 Gy and were given as a single fraction in the majority of the patients (31/33). Late complications consisting of intracranial bleeding and/or hemiparesis were observed in three patients. To date, 21 patients underwent repeat angiographic studies at 1 year post-treatment. A complete obliteration of the lesion was achieved in 38% of these patients. For the patients whose arteriovenous malformation nidus was covered by a minimum dose of 25 Gy, the total obliteration rate was 61.5% (8/13), whereas none of the patients who had received less than 25 Gy at the edge of the nidus obtained a total obliteration. Our preliminary analysis at 1 year post-radiosurgery reveals results comparable to those previously reported for other radiosurgical techniques for the same follow-up period
