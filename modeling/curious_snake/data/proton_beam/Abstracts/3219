Principles and scope of application of proton therapy in hospitals are discussed. Main distinctions between the dose distribution of megavolt gamma radiation and that of proton radiation are due to that the latter is totally absent behind the target and energy gradients along the lateral and back site boundaries of the proton irradiation field are high. Data on the operating proton therapy centers and those being designed are presented. The unjustifiably slow rate of integration of the proton technique with clinical practice is due to the time-consuming nature of relevant research. Possible ways and means of obviating the difficulties involved are discussed
