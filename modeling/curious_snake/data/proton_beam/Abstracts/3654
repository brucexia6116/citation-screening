The paper is concerned with the first results of treatment of 46 patients with tumors of the skin, oral mucosa and other sites using the Soviet small-size PMB-6E betatron with the energy of fast electrons at 6 MeV. The performance of the unit and different variants of dosimetric therapeutic plans of the fast electron beam are presented. Electron therapy with the energy of 6 MeV was mostly used in patients with head and neck tumors. Intra-oral irradiation with fast electrons was given to 4 patients with cancer of the moving part of the tongue and 5 patients with cancer of the fundic oral mucosa, the soft palate and the buccal mucosa in the form of combined or concomitant therapy. Summary focal doses in irradiation with fast electrons were 45-63 Gy for a combined or radical therapeutic course. A noticeable tumor regression was observed in patients with cancer of the skin, vermilion border and breast cancer recurrences. Though there were very few cases the results of concomitant and combined radiotherapy of cancer of the oral mucosa were promising. The first results of clinical application of the small-size PMB-6E betatron have shown its high efficacy for the treatment of superficial tumors
