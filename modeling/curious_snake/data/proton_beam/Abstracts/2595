A new method for external stereotactic focal irradiation of three-dimensional irregular target volumes is proposed. In this method the target is irradiated by a linear accelerator set in various angular positions around the isocenter. During the irradiation the target is translated in a direction perpendicular to the beam. By controlling the velocity of the translation it is possible to modify the configuration of therapeutic isodoses so as to make them follow the borders of the target
