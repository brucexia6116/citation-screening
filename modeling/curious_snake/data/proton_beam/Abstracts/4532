A malignant ciliary body melanoma received proton-beam irradiation. After an apparent failure of the tumor to respond, the eye was enucleated. A predominantly epithelioid cell tumor appeared viable by light microscopy, and a low degree of mitotic activity persisted, despite therapy. The tumor cells, however, displayed degenerative changes ultrastructurally, presumably results of the radiotherapy. These consisted of numerous cytoskeletal filaments, lipid vacuoles, prominent phagolysosomes, and nuclear convolutions and fragmentations. The mitochondria were fewer in number in the present tumor than typically encountered in epithelioid cells. A rare leptomeric structure was discovered, probably an organizational modification of the cytoplasmic filaments. The tumor's capillaries showed radiation-induced changes in terms of thickened basement membranes and perivascular fibrin deposition. The foregoing features are indicative of cellular and metabolic injury from the radiotherapy, but these were evidently not sufficiently injurious to sterilize the tumor
