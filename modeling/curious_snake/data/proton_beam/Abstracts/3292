The proportional counter microdosimetric technique has been employed to quantify variations in the quality of a d(48.5)+Be fast neutron beam passing through a homogeneous water phantom. Single event spectra have been measured as a function of spatial location in the water phantom and field size. The measured spectra have been separated into component spectra corresponding to the gamma, recoil proton and alpha plus heavy recoil ion contribution to the total absorbed dose. The total absorbed dose normalized to the "monitor units" used in daily clinical use has been calculated from the measured spectra and compared to the data measured with calibrated ion chambers. The present measurements agree with the ion chamber data to within 5%. The RBE of the neutron beam is assumed to be proportional to the microdosimetric parameter y* for the dose ranges pertinent to fractionated neutron therapy. The relative variations in y*, assumed to be representative of variations in the RBE are mapped as a function of field size and spatial location in the phantom. A variation in the RBE of about 4% for points within and 8% for points outside a 10 cm x 10 cm field is observed. The variations in the RBE within the beam are caused by an increase in the gamma component with depth. An increase in the RBE of about 4% is observed with increasing field size which is attributed to a change in the neutron spectrum. Compared to the uncertainties in the prescribed dose, associated with uncertainties in the clinically used RBE, variation in the RBE between various tissues, and other dosimetric uncertainties caused by factors such as patient inhomogeneities, patient setup errors, patient motion, etc., the measured spatial RBE variations are not considered significant enough to be incorporated into the treatment planning scheme
