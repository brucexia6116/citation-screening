The electron distribution F(x, y, z, theta x, theta y) in air has been evaluated for a clinical electron beam emanating from a scanning beam accelerator in which the collimation of the beam is performed by means of diaphragm collimators. The multiple scattering theory of Fermi turns out to be adequate in describing this electron distribution. In this theory, the only parameter to be determined experimentally is the angular variance at the level of the collimator blocks. Generally, this angular variance features the same energy dependence as the angular scattering power and its value at an arbitrary energy can be derived from measuring the penumbra widths of off-axis profiles in air, at various distances beyond the collimator blocks. Then, the angular variance at the level of a secondary diaphragm collimator can be calculated, as well as off-axis profiles in air at arbitrary distances. In this way, the relative electron distribution at the surface of patients can be calculated easily. This in turn serves adequately as input to the calculation of patient dose distributions in radiation therapy planning
