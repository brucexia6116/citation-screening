One of the quantitative methods used in DNA repair research is a measurement of the size-distribution of DNA fragments at different times following cell irradiation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the experimentally observed size-distributions of DNA fragments and the parameters of doublestrand break (DSB) repair. A biophysical model of DNA DSB repair in chromosomal DNA including DSB clusters repair was proposed. Complex shapes of (1) DNA fragments distribution at different repair times, (2) rejoining kinetics for DNA fragments in different length intervals, (3) total fragments rejoining kinetics were simultaneously described with rates of DSB repair different for active/inactive chromatin compartments
