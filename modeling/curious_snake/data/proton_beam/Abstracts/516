PURPOSE: To validate the MCNPX Monte Carlo simulation for radiobiologic studies of megavoltage grid radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: EDR2 films, a scanning water phantom with microionization chamber and MCNPX Monte Carlo code, were used to study the dosimetric characteristics of a commercially available megavoltage grid therapy collimator. The measured dose profiles, ratios between maximum and minimum doses at 1.5 cm depth, and percentage depth dose curve were compared with those obtained in the simulations. The simulated two-dimensional dose profile and the linear-quadratic formalism of cell survival were used to calculate survival statistics of tumor and normal cells for the treatment of melanoma with a list of doses of the fractionated grid therapy. RESULTS: A good agreement between the simulated and measured dose data was found. The therapeutic ratio based on normal cell survival has been defined and calculated for treating both the acute and late responding melanoma tumors. The grid therapy in this study was found to be advantageous for treating the acutely responding tumors, but not for late responding tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Monte Carlo technique was demonstrated to be able to provide the dosimetric characteristics for grid therapy. The therapeutic ratio was dependent not only on the single alpha/beta value, but also on the individual alpha and beta values. Acutely responding tumors and radiosensitive normal tissues are more suitable for using the grid therapy
