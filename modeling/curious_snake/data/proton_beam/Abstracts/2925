In order to establish the appropriate beam arrangement for use in stereotactic radiotherapy using a linear accelerator, dose volume distributions were calculated for a number of spherical targets in a head phantom and assessment was made by dose sparing of normal tissue outside the target volume. Using a single isocentre, fixed beam arrangements were compared with single and multiple non-coplanar isocentric arc rotations at target sizes from 10 to 55 mm diameter on a 6 MV Philips linear accelerator. From the dose-volume histograms produced, an arrangement of 3 or 4 arcs of rotation proved most suitable, in terms of sparing of normal tissue outside the target volume to high dose irradiation, across the range of target sizes studied. There was little further benefit with increasing the number of arcs beyond this. At target sizes greater than 20 mm diameter an arrangement of 6 static non-coplanar beams achieved sparing equivalent to multiple arc rotations and may have considerable advantages in the treatment of irregular volumes where customised beam shaping could be employed.
