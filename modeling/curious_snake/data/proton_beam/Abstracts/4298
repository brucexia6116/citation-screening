The Yang diffusion transport equation for charged particles was modified to allow the linear angular scattering power to vary with penetration depth in the scattering medium. Assuming charged particle energy loss to be a linear function of depth, conditional solutions to this transport equation have been found for the two cases of interest specified by Yang. The normalized excess path length distributions predicted for a 10-MeV electron beam show a shift toward larger excess path lengths compared to Yang's solutions
