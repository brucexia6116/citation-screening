Perturbations of charged particle equilibrium (CPE) at interfaces of materials of different atomic composition can lead to considerable differences in the energy deposition by photons and neutrons. Specific examples of these interface perturbations are encountered during irradiation of body cavities and soft tissue adjacent to bone or metallic implants and irradiation of cells in monolayer on the bottom of culture dishes. Another example is the build-up of CPE at air-tissue interfaces, referred to in radiotherapy as the skin sparing effect. For photon irradiation excess production of secondary electrons in high-Z materials, such as glass, bone or gold, will induce appreciably higher doses and decreased cell survival compared to the equilibrium situation. The energy dissipation of fast neutrons in biological materials occurs through recoil protons, heavy recoil nuclei and products of nuclear reactions. Owing to the large contribution from recoil protons to the neutron kerma, the hydrogen content of the biological material mainly determines the energy deposition. For neutron irradiation of cells in monolayer, CPE can be established or deliberately avoided by mounting tissue-equivalent plastic or carbon discs in front of the cells, respectively. This approach makes it possible to distinguish the biological effects of the low- and high-LET radiation components. [References: 21]
