Dosimetry measurements have been carried out for the electron beams produced by a linear accelerator at energies 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 21 MeV. Characteristic parameters of the central axis dose distributions were derived and compared to corresponding values of electron beams from other accelerators in clinical use where such a comparison is appropriate. A comprehensive set of dosimetric parameters is provided for electron beam treatment planning. The data include central axis depth dose, range-energy parameters, beam penumbra and uniformity
