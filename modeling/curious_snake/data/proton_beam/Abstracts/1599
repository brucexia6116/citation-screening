An overview is presented of radiation protection at high energy electron accelerator facilities. By 'high energy' is meant the energy domain beyond a few tens of MeV, where electromagnetic showers are the determining and dominant factor for beam interactions with matter. The basic components of electron accelerators are described and their potential impact on radiation safety. The paper then concentrates on sources of prompt radiation which distinguish these machines from other accelerator facilities and briefly describe other features such as shielding or safety systems as relevant to electron machines. A more comprehensive description of these aspects can be found elsewhere in these proceedings. In addition, general concepts presented in this review are complemented and illustrated by specific examples in the authors' synchrotron radiation work in these proceedings. [References: 36]
