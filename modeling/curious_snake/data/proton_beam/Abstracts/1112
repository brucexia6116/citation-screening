Bremsstrahlung photon beams produced by linac accelerators are currently the most commonly used method of radiotherapy for tumour treatments. When the photon energy exceeds 10 MeV the patient receives an undesired dose due to photoneutron production in the accelerator head. In the last few decades, new sophisticated techniques such as multileaf collimators have been used for a better definition of the target volume. In this case it is crucial to evaluate the photoneutron dose produced after giant dipole resonance (GDR) excitation of the high Z materials (mainly tungsten and lead) constituting the collimator leaves in view of the optimization of the radiotherapy treatment. A Monte Carlo approach has been used to calculate the photoneutron dose arising from the GDR reaction during radiotherapy with energetic photon beams. The simulation has been performed using the code MCNP4B-GN which is based on MCNP4B, but includes a new routine GAMMAN to model photoneutron production. Results for the facility at IRCC (Istituto per la Ricerca e la Cura del Cancro) Candiolo (Turin), which is based on 18 MV x-rays from a Varian Clinac 2300 C/D, are presented for a variety of different collimator configurations
