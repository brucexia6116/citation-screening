The success of proton therapy depends on its cost. Hospital based equipment in fabrication for the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston costs in the excess of 17 millions dollars, the accelerator being only a fraction of the cost. We think that price can be significantly decreased. We review the different new ways of accelerating protons currently under study in France in order to build a smaller, less expensive but reliable treatment device
