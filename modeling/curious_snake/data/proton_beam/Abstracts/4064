To date, few studies have evaluated the magnitude of the risks of somatic effects in humans from low-dose or protracted radiation exposure to neutrons using in vitro or in vivo techniques (A. Kronenberg, Radiat. Res. 128, S87-S93, 1991). In earlier study a strong energy dependence was shown for neutron-induced mutations at both the hprt and the tk loci in a rodent fibroblast cell line (Zhu and Hill, Radiat. Res. 139, 300-306, 1994). Using fast neutrons produced by impinging protons on a beryllium target at the UCLA/VA cyclotron, we have been examining the energy dependence of mutation induction at the HPRT locus in a human epithelial cell line derived from solid tumor tissue. In the present study, human epithelial teratocarcinoma cells were exposed to neutron beams produced from protons with 46, 30, 20 and 14 MeV energy. We found that cytotoxicity increased by 50% as the neutron beams produced from 46 MeV to 14 MeV, confirming many earlier reports. But as with the Chinese hamster cells, the mutation frequency at the HPRT locus increased 2.5-4-fold with decreasing neutron energy. Additionally, although there was a strong energy dependence for mutation induction, we noted that the shape of the induction curves was curvilinear for the human cells compared to the linearity of the curves obtained for the Chinese hamster cells and some other non-solid tissue human cell lines. Calculations of the RBE, using gamma rays as the standard reflected these differences. The RBE for mutation at the HPRT locus was dependent not only upon energy but also on dose, giving rise to RBEs that were in some cases distinctly different from those found in the Chinese hamster cell line. In the low-dose region (doses below 75 cGy) the maximum RBE of about 5 resulted from irradiation by the lowest-energy neutron beam (14 MeV protons on beryllium)
