At Istituto Tumori of Milano in a series of 3295 patients treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer from 1973 to 1989 three cases of soft tissue sarcoma were observed in irradiated breasts. One patient developed a fibrosarcoma of the breast stroma, 16 months after irradiation. A grade II bulky angiosarcoma was diagnosed in the breast of a patient treated 59 months previously. The third was a grade II angiosarcoma detected 41 months after therapy. At present, the risk of a second primary in the irradiated breast seems too low to justify modification of our present policy of conservative therapy of breast cancer, but a careful and longer follow-up is needed
