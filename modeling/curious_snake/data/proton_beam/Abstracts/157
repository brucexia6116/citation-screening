BACKGROUND: Single-dose-fraction conformal proton beam and multiple-fraction X ray dose schedules have been used to treat subfoveal neovascular membranes. All schedules successfully controlled membrane progression, stabilized vision in most patients, and increased visual acuity in some. Conformal protons also decreased the radiation dose to healthy tissues outside the designated volume (16 mm in diameter). It appears that radiation therapy could be useful and cost-effective, but neither the optimal time-dose schedule single or multiple dose fractions nor the type of radiation proton conformal beam or x-ray therapy are defined. METHODS: By means of an extensive literature survey, we reviewed the rationale for using radiation to treat subfoveal neovascularization, examined a paradigm of radiation interaction with tissue, reviewed the histopathology of neovascular membranes, and documented the role of growth factors in the pathophysiology of the disease. Accepting that the eye is an extracranial brain extension, and that its microvasculature has properties similar to brain microvessels, we reviewed the radiobiologic response of brain microvessels. We also revisited the controversy concerning the efficacy of single-dose-fraction vs. multifraction schedules. RESULTS: This paper outlines parameters within which radiation therapy's role might be defined, and proposes a clinical radiation-biology scoring program to evaluate radiation effects, based on the SOMA concept. CONCLUSION: A prospective, controlled clinical trial is feasible and is indicated to determine radiation therapy's role in managing the proliferative component of age-related macular degeneration.
