Recent studies of the intrinsic cellular sensitivity of 30 human in vitro cell lines to 4 MeV photons and 62.5 MeV (p-->Be+) neutrons have identified relatively neutron sensitive cell lines with high alpha values within the more resistant end of the photon radiation response range. Here we present data comparing the surviving fraction at 2 Gy of photons (SF2) to the surviving fractions at 1.6, 0.85 and 0.6 Gy of neutrons respectively (SF1.6 SF0.85 and SF0.6). With the ratio SF2/SF1.6 a negative trend can be seen between the probability of a preferential response to neutrons and relative photon resistance. With a ratio of SF2/SF0.6, however, a highly significant benefit for 62.5 MeV neutrons can be seen in the more photon resistant lines. We suggest further clinical studies to explore the potential relevance of these in vitro findings to the clinical situation should be undertaken
