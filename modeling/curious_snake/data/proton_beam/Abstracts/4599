Orbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) accounts for 10% of childhood RMS and has a relatively good prognosis of up to 85% 5-year survival. Improved survival has led to increased interest in late effects of treatment. The objective of this study was to review the results of treating orbital RMS with multidisciplinary treatment at Women's and Children's Hospital and Royal Adelaide Hospital with emphasis on late effects of treatment. A retrospective review was carried out of all patients with orbital RMS treated with multidisciplinary treatment including radiation therapy and chemotherapy in the two institutions between 1982 and 2002. A total of five patients (age range 5.5-12 years) satisfied the eligibility requirements. Late effects were significant and included facial bone hypoplasia, cataract formation and growth hormone deficiency. Overall survival was 80% (4/5) with mean follow up of 8 years (range 3-13 years). Given the high cure rates achieved, future treatments must aim to maintain the good results but to reduce the high incidence of late effects of treatment. Standardised rating of late toxicity, long-term follow-up clinics, and implementation of modern radiation techniques (3-D conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy) for patients with orbital RMS are important to improving outcome
