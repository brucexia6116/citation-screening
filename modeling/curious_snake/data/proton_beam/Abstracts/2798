A retrospective analysis of 63 patients with malignant major salivary gland tumours treated between 1972 and 1988 is presented. In 54 patients the tumour was located in the parotid gland, in the remaining nine patients the tumour was located in the submandibular gland, 31 patients were treated for stage I to II disease, 32 patients for stage III to IV disease. All patients were irradiated postoperatively using 60 Co. 137 Cs photons or electrons of adequate energies. As basic techniques ipsilateral portals, a wedge pair of portals or parallel opposed fields were used. The target doses ranged between 45 and 70 Gy with fractions of three to five times 2 to 3 Gy weekly, dependent on postoperative status and stage. In 25% of the patients a local recurrence was evident after radiotherapy with 13% developing distant metastases. The five-year survival was 95% for stage I, 83% for stage II, 30% for stage III and 7% for stage IV. Additionally, the prognosis varied according to lymph node involvement, grading and microscopic or macroscopic residual disease
