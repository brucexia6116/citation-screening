Protons have a long tradition in precision treatment of lesions of limited size at limited depth. Recently interest has developed in hospital based proton therapy accelerators, able to treat deep seated tumors. Heavy charged particles, and especially protons, are particularly suited to treat well localized tumors. Protons can be collimated as precisely as photons, but in addition have a well defined range. Protons are therefore predestinated for conformation radiotherapy also for larger target volumes. At the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research a computer optimized treatment planning system has been developed for pion radiotherapy. The principle of this dynamic treatment technique can be adapted for proton therapy. It could prove to be a valid alternative to passive scattering for proton treatment especially of large irregularly shaped volumes. Dose calculations have been performed for specific cases using a 250 MeV pencil beam. The dose distributions and dose volume histograms have been compared with pion therapy. A horizontal experimental beam line, using a degraded 590 MeV proton beam of the PSI ring cyclotron, is set up to verify calculations in phantoms
