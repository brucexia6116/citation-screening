Intraoperative radiotherapy is a technique that can be integrated into multidisciplinary treatment strategies in oncology. A radiation boost delivered with high energy electron beams can intensify locoregional antitumor therapy in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Intraoperative radiotherapy can increase the therapeutic index of the conventional combination of surgery and radiotherapy by improving the precision of radiation dose location, while decreasing the normal tissue damage in mobile structures and enhancing the biological effect of radiation when combined with surgical debulking. Intraoperative radiotherapy has been extensively investigated in clinical oncology in the last 15 years. Commercially available linear accelerators require minimal changes to be suitable for intraoperative radiotherapy. Its successful implementation in clinical protocols depends on the support given by the single institutions and on a clinical research-oriented mentality. Tumors where intraoperative radiotherapy as a treatment component has shown promising rates of local control include locally advanced rectal, gastric and gynecologic cancer, bone and soft tissue sarcoma. Intraoperative radiotherapy can be applied to brain tumors, head and neck cancer, NSCLC and pancreatic carcinoma
