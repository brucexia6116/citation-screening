Recent interest in stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial lesions, and the development of stereotactic irradiation techniques has led to the need for a systematic and complete comparison of these methods. A method for conducting these comparisons is proposed and is applied to a set of currently-used stereotactic radiosurgical techniques. Three-dimensional treatment planning calculations are used to compare dose distributions for several different radiation types and irradiation geometries. Calculations were performed using charged particles (H, He, C, and Ne ions) and the irradiation geometry currently used at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Photons in the Gamma Knife configuration and the Heidelberg Linac arc method are used. The 3-dimensional dose distributions were evaluated by means of dose-volume histograms and integral doses to the target volume and to normal brain. The effects of target volume, shape and location are studied. The charged particle dose distributions are more favorable than those of the photon methods. The differences between charged particles and photons increase with increasing target volume. The differences between different charged particle species are small, as are the effects of target shape and location
