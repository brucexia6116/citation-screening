The response of primary tumor to definitive radiation therapy and treatment related morbidity has been analysed in a group of 35 patients. All of them were treated with 20 MeV photon beam to a total dose of 67 to 71 Gy to the prostate. The effect of radiotherapy to a primary tumor were evaluated by means of repeated CT examination of the tumor volume. A statistically significant tumor regression was found to occur from the sixth month after finishing radiotherapy. The absolute majority of treatment complications was of the first grade. Neither moderate nor severe gastrointestinal or genitourinary complications were recorded. The follow-up data of our patients have confirmed that radiotherapy in localized prostatic carcinoma, when sophisticated techniques are employed, represents highly effective treatment modality which improved the quality of life in patients with prostate cancer
