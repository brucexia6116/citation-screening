Today, most sarcoma patients can be spared an amputation through the use of adjuvant radiotherapy. Treatment by an experienced multidisciplinary team offers the best chance of achieving permanent tumor control. Histopathologically-free resection margins are of the greatest importance. The indication for radiotherapy is determined by the recurrence risk profile of the individual patient. In addition to the well-proven postoperative irradiation, neoadjuvant radiotherapy is also successful. In the event of an unfavorably sited tumor, intra-operative irradiation can be applied in combination with either form. Patients with large G3 tumors can be given adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce the risk of distant metastases. On account of its appreciable toxicity, however, it should be reserved for patients younger than 65 in a good state of health. [References: 0]
