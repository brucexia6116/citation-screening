The Monte Carlo N-Particle radiation transport computer code (MCNP) has been employed on a personal computer to develop a simple model simulating the major components within the beam path of a linear accelerator radiation head, namely the electron target, primary conical collimator, beam flattening filter, wedge filter and the secondary collimators. The model was initially used to calculate the energy spectra and angular distributions of the x-ray beam for the Philips SL 75/5 linear accelerator, in a plane immediately beneath the flattening filter. These data were subsequently used as a 'source' of x-rays at the target position, to assess the emergent beam from the secondary collimators. The depth dose distributions and dose profiles at constant depth for various field sizes have been calculated for a nominal operating potential of 4 MV and found to be within acceptable limits. It is concluded that the technique may be used to calculate the energy spectra of any linear accelerator upon specification of the component dimensions, materials and nominal accelerating potential. It is anticipated that this work will serve as the basis of a quality control tool for linear accelerators and treatment planning systems
