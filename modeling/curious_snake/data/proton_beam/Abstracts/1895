The paper presents two cases of high-surgical-risk deep arteriovenous malformations (AVM) concurrent with aneurysms of the middle portion of the anterior ciliary artery (a male aged 35 years and a female aged 24 years). In the former case, aneurysm and large AVM in the left visual tuber were causes of 4 hemorrhages. In the latter, AVM of subcortical nodes and internal capsule were responsible for single hemorrhage. The patients underwent intraoperative embolization of the anterior ciliary artery followed by its clipping. This allowed the authors to exclude aneurysm and to achieve obliteration of the bulk of AVM. Operation were performed under intraoperative guidance of motor and speech functions. Residual AVM were exposed to proton beam radiation. The outcomes of treatment were good. After 4 months of surgery, the male had no neurological disorders; in the female motor and speech disorders were associated with prior hemorrhage. [References: 10]
