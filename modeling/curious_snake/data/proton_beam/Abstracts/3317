The field size dependent photon output is known to be influenced by the existence of backscattered radiation (BSR) generated in the collimator or trimmer jaws of a linear accelerator. This paper describes the results of measurements made to study the existence of such backscatter by simulating the geometry of the treatment head of a Therac-20 linear accelerator. The machine's monitor chamber, flattening filter, and collimator jaws were simulated by another real monitor chamber, a 1-cm thick lead sheet and 2.5-cm thick low-melting-point alloy divergent blocks, respectively. BSR from the simulated collimator jaws (SCJ) was measured with the simulated monitor chamber (SMC) as a function of the openings of the SCJ and as a function of distance between SMC and SCJ. The present results demonstrate the presence of BSR in an 18-MV photon beam from a Therac-20 linear accelerator
