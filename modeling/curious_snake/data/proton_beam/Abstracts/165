The aim was to determine whether proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of metabolites such as glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), choline, citrate and lactate in human seminal plasma can be used to differentiate (i) different azoospermic patients and (ii) different forms of spermatogenic failure including those who had undergone radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Semen samples were provided by men with obstructive azoospermia and spermatogenic failure who had serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) values within the normal range and either more or less than normal. Four prominent constituents of seminal plasma were identified by 1H-MRS: GPC, choline, citrate and lactate. The peak area ratios of choline/citrate as well as choline/lactate were significantly different (P < 0.01) between groups with spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia. When the serum FSH values were normal in men with spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia, a significant difference was found in the GPC/choline ratio (P < 0.001). When the FSH values were normal, the GPC/choline ratio appeared to be a very important parameter able to differentiate not only between cases of spermatogenic failure and obstructive azoospermia but also between different forms of spermatogenic failure. These results demonstrate the potential use of 1H-MRS on human seminal plasma in a new approach in the management of male infertility
