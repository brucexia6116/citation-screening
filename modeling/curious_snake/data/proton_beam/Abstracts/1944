A new treatment planning program was developed for the heavy ion therapy facility at GSI, which is tailored to the special needs for an active beam delivery using a magnetic raster scanner. It also includes a biological model for the estimation of biological effective dose for carbon ions and realizes a fully biological treatment planning. Biological effective dose distributions and RBE maps can be displayed and assessed from the graphical user interface
