Measurements of the energy loss of 70 MeV protons in phantom materials have been made, with a small uncertainty. Average stopping powers relative to water have been determined for the energy range between approximately 70 MeV and 40 MeV. These are expressed in terms of the mean excitation energy I of the Bethe theory. The effect of grains of inhomogeneous materials (e.g. calcium fluoride) has been explored and understood
