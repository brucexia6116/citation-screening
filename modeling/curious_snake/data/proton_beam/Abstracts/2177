Developments in Hadron therapy, i.e., fast neutrons, protons, pions, heavy ions and boron neutron capture therapy are reviewed. For each type of particle, operational and closed facilities are listed as well as planned new facilities. Improvements in clinical results have always been linked to technological developments and better physical selectivity of the irradiation. Exploring the benefit of further improvement in dose localization expected from protons and conformal therapy is the challenge for the coming years. The radiobiological rationale for high-LET radiation in cancer treatment, proposed in the fifties, is still valid and has not been contradicted by recent radiobiological findings. This justifies the planning of a therapy facility where protons and heavy ions (carbon ions) could be applied, under optimal physical and technical conditions. Appropriate selection between low- and high-LET radiation for a particular tumor is indeed a radiobiological problem, independent of technical development
