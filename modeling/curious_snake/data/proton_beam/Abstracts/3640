Further development of linear accelerators for medical purposes results in leaving off the principle of circular acceleration. The present investigation, comparing four clinically utilized electron linear accelerators with different constructional systems, reveals a large scale of clinical applicability, advantages and disadvantages partly compensating one another. None of the four machines examined offers a total of decisive advantages as compared to the other ones. Some essential data from the side of radiation exit are tested: depth dose data and photon contamination during operation with electrons, field sizes and homogeneity, penumbral width and penetration power for electron and X radiations. The appreciation of electron therapy by the radiologist may be a factor as well the handling of the machine, but in many cases the space available in an existing locality or the confidence in the ready service of a contracting firm, considerations concerning failure periods, estimate of repair and subsequent costs are influencing the decision for a certain type of equipment
