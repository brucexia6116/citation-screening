OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton therapy in complicated circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas. DESIGN: The study design was a retrospective review. PARTICIPANTS: Studied were 13 patients (13 eyes) who had circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. Of these, four eyes previously underwent laser unsuccessfully. INTERVENTION: Proton therapy including a total dose of 30 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent was administered to each eye. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were controlled for initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and tumor thickness on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range, 9-48 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 52 days. The tumor height decreased in all cases. Visual acuity improved to two lines or more in eight eyes (62%) and reached 20/200 or more in nine eyes (69%). No radiation complication was detected during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiation seems to be effective and safe in the management of choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment. It may be useful when photocoagulation can not be performed
