A new tube system for the betatron, which normally is only applied in percutaneous electron therapy, was developed at the Radiotherapeutic Department of the Medical Faculty of Istanbul. The new system allows to use the betatron also in transvaginal irradiation of the uterine cervix cancer. The authors describe the technical features of this system, its clinical application, and the results achieved. In great tumor centres where every type of malignant disease is treated, it is indispensable to dispose of the equipment necessary for certain very special cases, even if this equipment is not used frequently. In recent years, applicators for cavitary therapy and high voltage units for percutaneous therapy have been gradually substituted for the tube system employed in former times with orthovolt therapy units in intravaginal irradiation of cervical and vaginal carcinomas. There are cases, however, where the therapy techniques used nowadays are not sufficient or where a cavitary therapy should be used. Furthermore electrons which today can easily be produced for percutaneous surface therapy with linear accelerators can also be used for transvaginal therapy. We, too, have developed a new tube system which was attached to the betatron and used in intravaginal irradiation. This study describes the tube system, its clinical application, and the results achieved
