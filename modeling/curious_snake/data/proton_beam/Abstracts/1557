PURPOSE: To evaluate the results of proton beam irradiation of choroidal melanomas on a large series of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a series of patients treated with proton beam irradiation between 1991 and December 1998. The data were analyzed to evaluate the local tumor control as well as the general progression and metastatic rate of the patients. Statistical analysis served to isolate risk factors for relapse or metastasis. RESULTS: We treated 1062 patients during the study period, with a median follow-up of 38 months. Local control was obtained for 97.1% of the patients. Tumors anterior to the equator were at risk for relapse. The survival rate was 92% at 2 years and 78% at 5 years. 73.1% of the 1062 patients died from metastasis, 6.1% of living patients presented with metastatic disease. The risk factors for death were the initial diameter, the age of the patient, and large tumor volume at diagnosis. Metastasis were essentially hepatic (94.6%). Risk factors for metastasis were: a large tumor volume, a lesion anterior or straddling the equator and the age of the patient. Ocular complications may induce a visual loss of 0.1 and less in 47% of the patients, due to optic nerve head and macular ischemia. 6% of the patients required secondary enucleation due to local complications (neovascular glaucoma). CONCLUSION: Proton beam irradiation of choroidal melanoma allows good tumor control and eye retention. The survival prognosis is associated with the initial volume of the tumor. The functional results may be improved and new therapeutics are needed to treat metastatic disease
