Current dose measuring practices in the diagnostic and therapeutic use of radiation are reviewed. Radiation doses typically received by patients from diagnostic X-ray studies, including mammography and computerized axial tomography, are presented. Modern-day radiation therapy, both with conventional photons and with electrons and high-LET particles, emphasizes the need for accurate dosimetry. The different methods of beam calibration and dosimetry intercomparisons for the variety of radiation beams are discussed. Results of several important dosimetry intercomparisons are also presented.
