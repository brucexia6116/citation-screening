One of the major drawbacks to doing stereotactic radiosurgery with a linear accelerator is the long time required to deliver the target dose. Single fractions of 25 Gy delivered at the isocenter and at depth in the skull may require beam times in excess of 15 min for a typical linear accelerator with a maximum dose rate of 250 cGy/min in tissue. In an effort to decrease the treatment time for this technique, the flattening filter has been removed from an AECL Therac-6 linear accelerator and the characteristics of the resulting beam have been measured. Flatness is acceptable for the field sizes used with this technique and the dose rate is increased by a factor of 2.75
