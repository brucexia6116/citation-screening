The mammary gland cancer metastasizes most frequently into lymph nodes, the liver, bones, lungs and adrenal glands. Calculations of the combined coefficient of metastasizing showed the adenocarcinoma more frequently than other forms to metastasize into the lymph nodes of the chest, adrenals, and kidneys and less frequently into the liver; solid carcinoma with pseudoepidermoid metaplasia metastasizes into the brain more frequently than the other forms. The longest average survival after treatment (radical mastectomy, radiation therapy) was established in a more differentiated form of cancer - adenocarcinoma; the survival time after solid carcinoma and fibrous cancer is considerably shorter
