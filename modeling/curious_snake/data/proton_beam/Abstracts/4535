37 cases of conjunctival melanomas treated in the University Eye Clinic of Lausanne are analysed. This total is made of 20 men and 17 women aged between 19 and 81 years with a mean age of 54.7 years. Tumors were localized in the bulbar conjunctival in 27 cases, in the palpebral conjunctival in 2 cases and were diffuse in 8 cases. Cornea was infiltrated in 19 cases. In 21 cases, the first treatment was made in our service and 16 cases were recurrences following a treatment made elsewhere. The mortality rate to 5 years was 20%. In a multivariant analysis using the COX Model, the height of the tumor was the only significant parameter (p = 0.035) for life expectancy. Recurrence of the tumor (p = 0.060) and presence of a PAM (p = 0.652) were not significant parameters. Benefits of cryocoagulation and indications for a proton beam irradiation are discussed
