PURPOSE: For the treatment of Stage I non-small-cell lung cancers, a Phase I/II study of carbon ion irradiation was undertaken. In the present study, we focus on posttreatment radiographic lung damage: specifically, its timing, features, and relation to dose-volume factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with 44 Stage I non-small-cell lung cancers were treated with carbon ion irradiation ranging from 59.4 to 95.4 photon Gy equivalent dose (GyE) in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, according to our dose escalation protocols. Primary lesions were irradiated by 2-4 portals. Follow-up evaluation with computed tomography (CT) was sequentially performed to assess changes in the lung. CT findings were classified into two categories: pulmonary reaction and pleural reaction. A dose-volume histogram for each patient was calculated, using a three-dimensional CT planning system. Statistical analysis was conducted using Spearman's rank test. RESULTS: The median appearance period of pulmonary reactions was 3 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation, whereas the maximum period was 6 months. The severity of pulmonary reactions statistically correlated with lung volumes irradiated no less than 20 GyE (vol. 20) and 40 GyE (vol. 40) (p = 0.017 and p = 0.0089). Geometrically unique findings in the irradiated fields were observed in 7 patients (16%). The median appearance period of pleural reactions was 4 months after the start of carbon ion irradiation. The occurrence of pleural reactions significantly correlated with planning target volume (p = 0.000098), vol. 20 (p = 0.00011), and vol. 40 (p = 0.00097). CONCLUSIONS: Lung damage after carbon ion irradiation was observed in the parenchyma and in the pleura. The severity of pulmonary reactions was correlated with dose-volume factors. These findings might provide useful information in the planning and management of carbon ion irradiation
