The article analyses the immediate and late-term results of treatment of endosellar pituitary adenomas: removal through a transsphenoidal approach--16 patients, transnasal stereotaxic administration of 90Y--14 patients, irradiation by proton beam--263 patients. Surgery as well as radiotherapy produced quite satisfactory results. Proton therapy on a Leningrad synchrocyclotron is not inferior to the modern surgical methods in efficacy and safety. It is indicated in endosellar pituitary adenomas when the sella turcica measures no more than 20 x 16 mm
