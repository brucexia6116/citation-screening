Stereotactic radiotherapy has two advantages: (a) the possibility of giving high radiation doses to small but spatially well-defined target volumes and (b) the presence of a stepped dose gradient between the target volume and the surrounding healthy tissues. To utilize these advantages, the authors built a new stereotactic head frame by which the intracranial target is fixed to the rotational isocenter of a 4-MV linear accelerator. The collimator openings are selected according to the volume and the three-dimensional configuration of the target, and the radiation dose is based on the radiosensitivity of the lesion. After the patient is fixed to the frame, the radiation source and the patient are rotated so that the target is irradiated through infinite portals distributed over the convexity of the skull. It is thereby possible to obtain very high radiation doses centered into the target with a stepped dose gradient. The preliminary radiodosimetric tests and the operative technique are described. The advantages of this technique compared to interstitial radiotherapy and Leksell's radiosurgery are emphasized. This noninvasive procedure has been used to treat a series of intracranial tumors
