This study assesses the efficacy and neurotoxicity of radiosurgical treatment of benign intracranial tumors using a linear accelerator, with relatively low dose and homogeneous dosimetry. Between June 1998 and July 2000, 27 patients were treated for benign lesions with radiosurgery using a 6-MV linear accelerator-based X-knife system and circular collimators. The lesions included schwannoma, meningioma, papillary cyst adenoma, and hemangioblastoma. Five patients had tissue diagnosis. The mean peripheral dose to the tumor margin was 12.8 Gy. The mean dose to the isocenter was 16.3 Gy. One to five isocenters were used to treat these lesions, with a mean of 10 arcs per isocenter and mean collimator size of 1.25 cm. Follow-up information was available on all patients, with a mean follow-up duration of 33 months. Six patients (22%) had improved symptoms and 21 (78%) had stable symptoms. Eight patients (30%) had regression of tumor and 19 had stable disease (70%). No patient had tumor progression, and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade III or IV toxicity did not occur in any patients. In 3 patients (11%), RTOG grade I or grade II neurotoxicity developed. Of these, one patient had worsening of a preexisting VIIth nerve deficit that required temporary oral methylprednisolone, and in two patients a mild trigeminal deficit developed that did not require any medical intervention. Low-dose homogeneous radiosurgery using a linear accelerator is an effective treatment for benign intracranial tumors. If lower, more homogeneous radiation doses produce responses as durable as higher doses, then toxicity might be further reduced
