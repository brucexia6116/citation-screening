Proton beam therapy is now widely recognized as the most precise form of radiation treatment available for certain types of diseases. As such, there is an ever-increasing demand for efficient hospital-based systems capable of providing proton therapy on a routine basis. A hospital-based proton-beam treatment center consists of many systems that must be integrated to form a single simple-to-operate and maintain medical device. The system must be capable of accelerating the proton beam to the needed energies safely and effectively, transporting the beam successfully to the appropriate treatment room, and shaping the proton beam to the desired target volume within the patient. This paper overviews the major systems needed to meet these objectives as part of a complete proton-beam treatment system. This paper focuses on the areas of beam acceleration, beam transport, and beam delivery methods, including an introduction to both passive and active beam delivery methods. Additionally, it introduces and provides examples of the required simplicity and types of automation needed to achieve a high-capacity proton-beam treatment system, with specific examples based on use at the system at Loma Linda University Medical Center
