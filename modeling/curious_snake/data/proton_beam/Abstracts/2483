Forty-two healthy volunteers, aged 19 to 49, participated in three bed rest studies of 69 to 180 days in duration. The test subjects were kept on the diet consisting of dehydrated foods: fresh, stored for up to 2 years, and exposed to proton irradiation at a dose of 24,000 rad. Metabolism of amino acids was investigated under these conditions. It was concluded that during prolonged storage and irradiation proteins of dehydrated foods retained their biological value. This allows their use in long-term space flights
