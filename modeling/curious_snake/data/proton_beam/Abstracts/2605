We have studied the ESR response of proton-irradiated (in vitro) bone. The ESR response as a function of proton (E = 105 MeV) dose to bone was linear from 0 to 50 Gy and similar to the photon (E = 6 MV) dose response. The ESR depth response (Bragg) curve was depressed as compared to a depth-response curve determined with a parallel plate ionization chamber (PPIC). There was a short-term ESR signal fade in the Bragg peak region, likely attributable to the organic component in bone. We are continuing to investigate these latter two effects
