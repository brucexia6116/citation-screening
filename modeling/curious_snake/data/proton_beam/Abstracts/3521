252Cf (Cf) was used to treat tumors of the cervix and uterus with neutron brachytherapy (NT) in an ongoing clinical trial. Tandem and ovoids insertions were used and combinations of single and multiple applications along with high dose whole pelvic irradiation. Dosimetric analysis of treated cases for patterns of tissue dose were carried out. Tissue dose for Cf-NT was, in general, high for neutron components in the central pelvis only, and fell off rapidly with distance from the applicators. The majority and balance of therapeutic dose was contributed by low linear energy transfer (LET) high energy photon beam radiation to the whole pelvis. Comparison with fast neutron beam therapy (NBT) isodose curves showed that much more homogeneous neutron dose was delivered to the pelvic tumor and organs by NBT. Complication frequency has been reported to be higher for neutron beam therapy than for Cf-NT. It appears that the higher integral neutron biological dose to normal tissues for NBT compared to intracavitary Cf-NT probably contributed to the frequency of side effects
