Since January 2001, radiotherapy treatments with modulated intensity beams (IMRT) have started at the Centre Oscar-Lambret. This paper presents the tests and measurements made before the clinical implementation as well the quality control performed before each routine treatment. We use the treatment planning system Helax-TMS (MDS-Nordion) and the Primus accelerator (Siemens) linked to the Lantis network with Primeview and Simtec modules (Siemens) allowing to deliver intensity modulated beams with Step-and-Shoot technique. A prostate case and a head and neck case have been studied and have permitted to evaluate the benefit of IMRT compared to a "classical" conformal radiotherapy. In a second time, we have tested the accelerator's capabilities to deliver these intensity modulated beams, id-est, the accuracy of the leaf positions and the linearity of the monitor chamber. The third step has been the verification of the dose distributions calculated by Helax-TMS, id-est, the dose for different segment sizes, the dose profiles for an intensity modulated beam and the dose distribution for all the traitment beams. The used phantom has been especially developed at the Centre Oscar-Lambret for IMRT. The results have allowed to start clinical treatments and to establish a quality control set for this technique. The next step is the real time dosimetry with a portal imager
