Portal verification images were generated from the photon contamination in electron beams produced by a linear accelerator during treatment of patients receiving high-energy electron radiation therapy (8-14 MeV). An experimental storage phosphor system was used to record the images and display them on laser-printed film. Images were obtained from four or more treatment fractions from 21 cases of head and neck cancer. Precision in field placement was estimated by determining the position of a selected anatomic landmark relative to the center of the field for each series of images. The average standard deviation in the field-position measurements was 3.8 mm. Several procedural problems were also detected and corrected after review of the verification images. The results indicate that the emphasis placed on monitoring and control of field-positioning error in high-energy electron treatments should be similar to the emphasis placed on this aspect of error in photon treatment
