Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) differs from conventional proton therapy in its ability to deliver depth-shifted, arbitrarily complex proton fluence maps from each incident field direction. As the individual Bragg peaks delivered from any field can be distributed in three-dimensions throughout the target volume, IMPT provides many more degrees of freedom for designing dose distributions than IMRT or conventional proton therapy techniques. So how can the flexibility of IMPT best be exploited? Here we argue that IMPT has two main advantages over photon IMRT and conventional proton therapy: the ability to better 'sculpt' the dose to the target and around neighbouring critical structures, and the ability to find clinically acceptable solutions whilst simultaneously reducing the sensitivity of the treatments to potential delivery errors. The concept of IMPT as a tool for generating 'safer' plans opens an interesting new avenue of research from the point of view of plan optimisation, the potential of which is only just beginning to be explored
