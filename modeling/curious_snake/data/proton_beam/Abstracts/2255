Modern radiation therapy of tumors within the regions of the head and neck regards not only the concept of the target volume but also the probability of affection to the lymphatic chains. Frequency of spread to lymph nodes depends on the size of the primary tumor, and thus the extent of radiotherapeutic practical measures can be conformed to the TNM system. A radiation therapy planned in view of the TNM classification may be termed, therefore, as a systematized radiation therapy. From the standpoint of these considerations irradiation techniques using a telecobalt therapy unit and a betatron have been examined considering the application to individual toumor sites and tumor volumes in the regions of the head and neck. The techniques being most appropriate for tumors of the head and neck, with regard to the various sites or volumes, and taking into account the target volume as well as the lymphatic chains concerned are here presented
