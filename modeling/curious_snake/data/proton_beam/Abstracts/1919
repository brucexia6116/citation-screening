Nineteen patients with inextirpable skull base meningioma with involvement of neurovascular structures were given irradiation with a 180 MeV proton beam at the The Svedberg Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden. The patients were treated seated in a fixed position with a stereotactic approach. Titanium-markers to the outer table served for identification and verification of the target positioning for dose planning and irradiation. The patients were given a total dose of 24 Gy in four consecutive daily 6 Gy fractions. All patients have been followed for at least 36 months. So far no meningiomas have progressed after treatment. Two patients have developed corticosteroid responsive oedema in the target area 6 moths after treatment. Late, but not serious, symptoms of side effects have been observed in one patient
