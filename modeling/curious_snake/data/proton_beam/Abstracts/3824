The Ge(4He, xn) and 75As(p, 3n) reactions were compared as the best potential routes for routine production of selenium-73 (73Se) for medical applications. With 26 MeV alpha particles, available with compact cyclotrons, the first reaction required an enriched 70Ge target of sodium metagermanate to give a production yield of 1 mCi/microAh (0.037 GBq/microAh) in a 105 mg/cm2 target. With 55 MeV protons the As(p, 3n) reaction on natural arsenic yielded 20 mCi/microAh (0.74 GBq/microAh) in a 685 mg/cm2 target. A simple method was developed and optimized for both targets in order to isolate and purify the no-carrier-added selenium in the elemental form with a radiochemical yield greater than 75% in less than 90 min. An automated radiochemical processing unit has been designed for the routine production of 100-150 mCi (3.7-5.5 GBq) batches of carrier-free 73Se ready for radiopharmaceutical labeling. 30 mCi (1.11 GBq) (EOS) of L-2-amino-4-([73Se]methylseleno) butyric acid (L-[73Se]selenomethionine) ready for injection with a specific activity of 5 Ci/mmol (185 GBq/mmol) (EOS) were obtained through a fast chemical synthesis. Radiation absorbed dose estimates for L-[73Se]selenomethionine have been determined. A value of 0.70 rem/mCi (0.19 mSv/MBq) administered was calculated for the risk from irradiation in man. The first human PET investigation with [73Se]selenomethionine showed a very good delineation between liver and pancreas
