PURPOSE: To analyze the water equivalent pathlength (WEL) fluctuations resulting from cardiac motion and display these variations on a beam's-eye-view image; the analysis provides insight into the accuracy of lung tumor irradiation with heavy charged particle beams. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric cine computed tomography (CT) images were obtained on 7 lung cancer patients under free-breathing conditions with a 256-multislice CT scanner. Cardiac phase was determined by selecting systole and diastole. A WEL difference image (DeltaWEL) was calculated by subtracting the WEL image at end-systole from that at end-diastole at respiratory exhalation phase. Two calculation regions were defined: Region 1 was limited to the volume defined by planes bounding the heart; Region 2 included the entire body thickness for a given beam's-eye-view angle. RESULTS: The DeltaWEL values observed in Region 1 showed fluctuations at the periphery of the heart that varied from 20.4 (SD, 5.2) mm WEL to -15.6 (3.2) mm WEL. The areas over which these range perturbation values were observed were 36.8 (32.4) mm(2) and 6.0 (2.8) mm(2) for positive and negative WEL, respectively. The WEL fluctuations in Region 2 increased by approximately 3-4 mm WEL, whereas negative WEL fluctuations changed by approximately -4 to -5 mm WEL, compared with WEL for Region 1; areas over 20 mm WEL changes in Region 2 increased by 9 mm(2) for positive DeltaWEL and 2 mm(2) for negative DeltaWEL. CONCLUSIONS: Cine CT with a 256-multislice CT scanner captures both volumetric cardiac and respiratory motion with a temporal resolution sufficient to estimate range fluctuations by these motions. This information can be used to assess the range perturbations that charged particle beams may experience in irradiation of lung or esophageal tumors adjacent to the heart
