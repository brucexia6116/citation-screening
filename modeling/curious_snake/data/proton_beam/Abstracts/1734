BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment of large cerebral arteriovenous malformations is a challenge for embolization, surgery and radiosurgery too. The purposes of this study is to review results of RS for these large cerebral arteriovenous malformations and to study recent methods which can allow to improve results. PATIENTS: and method. From our series, 112 patients had cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 30 mm or 10 cc at time of the radiosurgery. Revelation mode was hemorrhage in 47%, seizures in 42%, headaches in 16%, and progressive neurological deficits in 7%. Discovery was fortuitous in 2.7% of cases. Before radiosurgery, 57% were embolized, 5% were operated, 4.5% were reirradiated and 1.8% were operated and embolized. Distribution according to Spetzler & Martin's grade was following: 0% in grade I, 12% in grade II, 41% in grade III and 46% in grade IV. No patient was in grade V. RESULTS: Global obliteration rate was 39% for large cerebral arteriovenous malformations. In multivariate analysis, only recovering (positive correlation), and previous embolization (negative correlation) were correlated with obliteration rate. CONCLUSION: Current procedures of radiosurgery allow obliteration in a limited number of large cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated. Other strategies as fractioned irradiation, multileaf microcollimators with single isocenter, radiosurgery before surgery or radiosurgery with protons should improve obliteration rate.
