Progresses of the three-dimensional imageries and of the software of planning systems makes that the radiotherapy of the tumours of brain and the base of skull is increasingly precise. The set-up of the patients and the positioning of the beams are key acts whose realization can become extremely tiresome if the requirement of precision increases. This precision very often rests still on the visual comparison of digital images. In the near future, the development of the automated systems controlled by robots should allow a noticeable improvement of the precision, safety and speed of the patient set-up. [References: 24]
