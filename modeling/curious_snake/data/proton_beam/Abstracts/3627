Several technical advances in radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer have recently been reported. For early superficial cancer in the hilar region, intracavitary brachytherapy with an Ir-192 source combined with external radiotherapy is very effective; the 5-year survival rate can exceed 85%. For peripheral-type early non-small cell lung cancer the local control rate with conventional external radiotherapy remains about 50%. Heavy-particle therapy with protons or heavy-ion beams is promising. Radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy is routinely used to treat locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The optimal combination of these treatments is an important subject for future research. [References: 8]
