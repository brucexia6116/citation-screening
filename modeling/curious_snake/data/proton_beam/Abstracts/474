A state vector model (SVM) for chromosome aberrations and neoplastic transformation has been adapted to describe detrimental bystander effects. The model describes initiation (formation of translocations) and promotion (clonal expansion and loss of contact inhibition of initiated cells). Additional terms either in the initiation model or in the rate of clonal expansion of initiated cells, describe detrimental bystander effects for chromosome aberrations as reported in the scientific literature. In the present study, the SVM with bystander effects is tested on a suitable dataset. In addition to the simulation of non-linear effects, a classical dataset for neoplastic transformation in C3H 10T1/2 cells after alpha particle irradiation is used to show that the model without bystander features can also describe LNT-like dose responses. A published model for bystander induced neoplastic transformation was adapted for chromosome aberration induction and used to compare the results obtained with the different models
