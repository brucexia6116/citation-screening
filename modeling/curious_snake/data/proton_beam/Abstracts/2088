The measurement of stereotactic radiosurgical dose distributions requires an integrating, high-resolution dosimeter capable of providing a spatial map of absorbed dose. Although radiographic film is an accessible dosimeter fulfilling these criteria, for larger radiotherapy photon fields the sensitivity of film emulsion exhibits significant dependencies on both depth in phantom and field size. We have examined the variation of film sensitivity over the ranges of depths and field sizes of interest in radiosurgery with a 6 MV photon beam. While for large (20cm x 20cm) fields the potential error in dose due to the variation of the film response with depth reaches 15%, the corresponding maximum error for a 2.5 cm diameter radiosurgical beam is 1.5%. This uncertainty was observed to be comparable in magnitude to that produced by variation in processing conditions (1.1%) and by varying the orientation of the film plane relative to the beam central axis (1.5%). The dependence of emulsion sensitivity on field size has been observed to be negligible for fields ranging in diameter from 1.0 cm to 4.0 cm. The source of the dependence of film sensitivity has been illustrated by using an EGS4 Monte Carlo simulation for large fields to illustrate significant increases in the photon spectrum below 400 keV with depth in phantom. In contrast, relative increase of this low-energy component is negligible for radiosurgical photon fields
