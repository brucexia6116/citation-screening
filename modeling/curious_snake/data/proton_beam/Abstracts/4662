Inheritable chromosome aberrations (CA) are of concern because cytogenetic damage may trigger the carcinogenic process. Moreover, stability of radiation-induced CA is a prerequisite for meaningful biological dosimetry. CA inheritability arguably depends on the aberration structure, with symmetrical exchanges being favoured over asymmetrical rearrangements, but it is also affected by radiation quality. CA induced by low-LET protons and high-LET 12C ions in G0 peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured in first- , second- and third-generation by combined FISH/harlequin staining of metaphase as well as prematurely condensed interphase chromosomes 1 and 2. As expected, the frequency of non-transmissible (NT) aberrations declined through replication rounds. A radiation-induced arrest occurred prior to first post-irradiation mitosis that prevalently affected aberrant cells. Aberrant cells incurred cycle delays also at subsequent cycles following proton-irradiation but not 12C ion-irradiation. As expected, the frequency of reciprocal translocations remained fairly stable while that of dicentrics was halved at each mitotic round. A significant fraction of complex-type exchanges was found in third-generation cells following both irradiations and appeared to be transmitted relatively more efficiently after protons than 12C ions. A low but stably transmitted frequency of transmissible (T)-type insertions were detected after 12C ions but not after low LET-irradiation. Our data support a differential ability by aberrant cells to progress through post-irradiation mitoses that is influenced by the aberration burden and radiation quality
