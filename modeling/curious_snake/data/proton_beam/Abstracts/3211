The adaptive response (AR) in human lymphocytes in different experimental protocols was investigated. The AR was found to be present in cells pre-exposed to 3 cGy of X-rays in G0, G1 and S phase as well as with tritiated water (4 muCi/ml) when the 'challenge' dose was given in G2. There was no AR after prior exposure of the cells in S phase to secondary irradiation from 70 GeV protons. The AR was not observed after preliminary X-irradiation of the lymphocytes in G0 and G1 and 'challenge' irradiation in G1. Cells from 6 patients with Down's syndrome were tested. At least 5 of them did not show the AR. The AR is considered to be a phenomenon of the antimutagenic aftereffect
