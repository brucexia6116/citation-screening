Analytic microdosimetry using Fourier transform techniques has been applied to internal alpha emitters. These techniques need revision and simplification for use with short-lived radionuclides such as those which may be useful for radioimmunotherapy. Analytic methods may have advantages over Monte Carlo methods in some cases (e.g., where time is important). Applications to eight different source geometries show the usefulness of these techniques. Comparisons of some of the results of Monte Carlo calculations prove its accuracy. For a uniform source of 5.867-MeV alphas spread throughout the volume outside a cell surface, the two methods agree well. Results are within 1% both for the average specific energy and for the number of hits. Analytic microdosimetry provides an alternate method to use for the critical evaluation of models that seek to predict the relation between alpha energy deposition and cell survival data. Similarly, it may be helpful to point the way toward the rational interpretation of general biological results for antibodies labeled with alpha emitters
