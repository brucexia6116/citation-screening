The behavior of the head-scatter factor in shielded 6 and 25 MV X-ray beams from a Philips SL25 linear accelerator was investigated by measuring incident fluences by direct (in-air) and indirect (in-phantom) methods. It was found that perturbations in head-scatter produced by shielding blocks arranged to define a slit-shaped field are considerably less than 1% in unwedged beams, even when 80% of a 20 x 20 cm2 field is shielded. The results are independent of beam energy and orientation of the slit with respect to the collimator jaws. When a 60 degrees wedge is inserted, the head-scatter factor decreases by up to a few percent, depending on slit direction but not on energy. The contributions to head-scatter from the block tray and the shielding blocks are negligible
