From August, 1977, through January, 1981, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group sponsored a Phase I study (RTOG 77-09) on the use of fast neutrons for treating inoperable squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus. A total of 39 evaluable patients were treated with curative intent using either fast neutrons alone or in combination with low LET irradiation as part of a mixed beam fractionation scheme. Actuarial survival curves are presented for both the "neutrons alone" and the "mixed beam" treatment groups. There was no significant survival difference between these groups of patients. The projected survival at two years is less than 10%, which is comparable with megavoltage photon results for an unselected series of patients. The size of the primary lesion and the initial Karnofsky performance status were found to be the most important prognostic indications for prolonged survival. Sixteen of 39 patients were felt to have achieved local clearance of their tumor at some time during their follow-up with the median time until a local recurrence being 17 months. Treatment related complications and patterns of metastatic spread are discussed. In general, it appeared that the response of large tumors to neutron irradiation resulted in necrosis and fistula formation. In many cases this was accompanied by persistent/recurrent tumor within the high dose radiation volume
