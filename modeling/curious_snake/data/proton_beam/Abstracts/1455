Since December 1997, patients are treated with carbon ions at GSI (Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung). Dose delivery is performed with the intensity-controlled raster-scanning technique, which allows a highly conformal treatment of the tumor. To meet the special requirements of dosimetry with heavy ion beams, new dosimetric measurement techniques were developed and introduced into clinical application by the DKFZ (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum). The techniques comprise calibration of the irradiation monitor, checks of lateral and depth dose profiles, as well as verification of the beam delivery for complex three-dimensional dose distributions. The developed dosimetric methods are now integral part of clinical application and enable safe treatment with carbon ion therapy. [References: 27]
