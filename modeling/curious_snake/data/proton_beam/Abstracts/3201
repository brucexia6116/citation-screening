Daily control measurements of the dose taken at a linear accelerator are described in order to present a practice-oriented measurement and evaluation method rendering possible a long-term quality control. This method allows to establish sudden parameter variations as well as to determine in a simple and precise manner long-term drifting effects with an amplitude within the range of measurement variations and a period of many months. During the time of six months, not only a drifting effect with a long period and an amplitude within the range of pro mille, but also a variation coefficient smaller than 0,3% could be determined
