A PC-based, three-dimensional treatment planning system, which may be used for planning of radiosurgical treatments with the Gamma unit or with any of the radiosurgical techniques based on isocentric linear accelerators (linacs), is described and used to calculate isodose distributions for various linac-based radiosurgical techniques ranging from the single plane rotation to a 4-pi geometry. The latter gives an isotropic dose falloff outside the target volume but cannot be used for practical radiosurgery, while the single plane rotation is simple to use but gives unacceptably shallow dose falloffs in the transverse plane. Dose falloffs for several other techniques of varying degrees of complexity are shown and discussed. Also discussed is the effect of beam energy and beam profiles on radiosurgical dose distributions
