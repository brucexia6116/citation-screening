In the last few years there has been a significant increase in the number of centers having, or developing, both high- and low-linear energy transfer (LET) microbeams for radiobiological investigations. In this review, we will discuss the various approaches for developing low-LET single cell irradiation devices and consider the instrument designs and how the machines capabilities can be exploited to investigate targeted and non-targeted effects of low-LET irradiation.
