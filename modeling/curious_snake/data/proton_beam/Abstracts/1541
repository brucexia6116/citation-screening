The method has been proposed for active control of distribution of the dose caused by an electron beam passed through the medium. The method is based on the influence of magnetic field on charged particles and it allows concentrating of the absorbed dose in the prescribed area. To investigate this method the Monte-Carlo simulations were carried out for 20-70 MeV electrons in 0.5-3 T magnetic field using GEANT program. From the obtained results it follows that in the uniform magnetic field the maximum in distribution of the electron beam dose appears and its shape is similar to Bregg's peak for heavy charged particles. The location of the maximum may be changed by varying beam energy and magnetic fields configuration. For 60-70 MeV beam the maximum may be obtained at the depth of 10-15 cm that is convenient for radiotherapeutic usage
