Radiobiological studies targeted at determination of the coefficients of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of various radiations in comparison with the standard X-ray radiation at 180-250 keV maximum were reviewed. Comparison of reactions of the body as a whole and its specific systems shortly after acute irradiation revealed the character of the relationship of RBE coefficients to LET. These data are essential for more careful estimation of radiation risk during space missions when, in parallel with chronic exposure to determinant sources, i.e. GCR and ERB, crew members may be also subjected to comparatively brief SCR attacks, particularly during solar proton events with high fluences.
