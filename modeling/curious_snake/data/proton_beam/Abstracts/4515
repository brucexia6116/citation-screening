The authors summed up their 20-year experience in the clinical use of a linear accelerator of electrons and a Siemens betatron (42 MeV) in the Research Institute of Oncology and Radiology, Ministry of Health of the Byelorussian SSR. Comparative advantages and shortcomings of both accelerators and the results of their technical modifications were considered. A section in the paper, devoted to the clinical aspects of tumor therapy, is concerned with the description of a number of methods of irradiation with various types of therapeutic beams, energies, field sizes, directions, various regimens of dose fractionation in time and irradiated volume. Long-term results of radiotherapy with accelerators were assessed and compared with the results of gamma-beam therapy on cobalt units. A conclusion was made that by 1991-2000 the Republic would need 10 medical accelerators
