The results of therapy of 55 head and neck tumor patients using fast neutrons of the Y-120 cyclotron of the Research Institute of Nuclear Physics, Tomsk Polytechnical Institute, were analyzed. For design of courses of neutron and combined neutron-photon therapy formulas of DMF calculation were used in cases of homogeneous and arrhythmic dose fractionation. The authors presented some data on methods of therapy with fast neutrons, dose fractionation schedules, a focal dose value, and time of treatment. Complete tumor regression was noted in 50-54% of cases using fast neutrons alone or in combination with photon radiation. A high sensitivity to neutron radiation of nonepidermoid carcinomas as compared to epidermoid cancer types was established with relation to tumor morphological structure
