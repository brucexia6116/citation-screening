We report the case of a 23-year-old female with severe neurologic dysfunction without a clear cause at the time of initial presentation. The search for an underlying malignancy revealed a slightly enlarged cervical lymph node with Hodgkin's disease (HD). There was no evidence of a brain tumor despite nonspecific bright changes in proton density in the basal ganglia of the right hemisphere of the cerebellum, right cerebellar tonsil, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and the right side of the medulla spinae as shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as reactive lymphocytosis with slightly elevated protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The findings suggested a cerebellar disorder, with main differential diagnosis between neurologic paraneoplastic syndrome (NPS) and HD involving the CNS. Based on limited experience with NPS and HD in the CNS, possible diagnostic and therapeutic options are discussed
