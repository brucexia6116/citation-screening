Sequential MR imaging could provide information related to the pathological changes due to the application of external cytotoxic agents such as radiotherapy on the central nervous system. This paper describes the results of our attempt to demonstrate short-term changes associated with normal brain during and immediately following radiotherapy when the whole brain is irradiated for malignant conditions. No observable changes were found in the normal brain parenchyma in any of the patients (n = 8) in T1-, T2-, and proton-density-weighted images in the sequential scans in the first and second weeks and immediately following radiotherapy. Also, no changes were observed in the normal brain appearance at 2 mo (n = 6), up to 6 mo (n = 1), and up to 15 mo (n = 1) after completion of radiotherapy
