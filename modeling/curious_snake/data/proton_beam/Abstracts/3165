For negative pions, large differences exist between experimental RBE values obtained by in vivo investigations with animals and corresponding data being used in clinical tumor therapy. Therefore, the influence of the treatment volume on the radiation quality and respectively on the RBE is examined. The RBE for euoxic mammalian cells is measured with high precision in different volumes irradiated in the spot-scan mode with the PIOTRON at the Paul Scherrer Institute. It is shown experimentally that the RBE is reduced if the radius of the irradiation volume is increased. Using a simple mathematical approximation for the spot-scan technique this relation can be understood quantitatively. The same approximation is also used to calculate dose mean values for the lineal energy yD present in different irradiated volumes. The good agreement with existing experimental data for yD indicates that the approximation used is adequate and the main physical parameters have been taken into consideration. The above mentioned differences between animal experiments and treatment of patients can be explained by changes in the effective radiation quality due to the scanning procedure used in the clinical treatments
