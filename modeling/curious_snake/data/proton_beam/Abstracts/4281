PURPOSE: For management of muscle-invading bladder cancer (clinical stages T2 to T4), combined treatment of definitive radiotherapy (RT) and intraarterial (IA) administration of chemotherapy was carried out for local cure and bladder preservation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1987 and 1990, a pilot study (Protocol-1) was initially conducted in 16 patients to investigate the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy where RT was combined with TURB and continuous IA infusion of cisplatin. We then performed a regimen of possible bladder-preservation treatment (Protocol-2) in which 19 patients were treated with combination of TURB, full-dose RT and one-shot IA infusion of cisplatin and methotrexate. In RT small pelvis irradiation was performed with x-rays followed by proton beam boost irradiation to the original tumor site. RESULTS: Among patients treated on Protocol-1, a tumor-free bladder was observed in 50% (2/4) after 50-76 Gy but only 8% (1/14) after 30-40 Gy. In this regimen, planned cystectomy was performed in 10 patients and 13 patients (81%) are alive. Among 19 patients treated on Protocol-2, 17 patients (89%) are alive and 13 patients (68%) retained intact bladders without any recurrence. There were 3 cystectomies performed because of persistent tumors. Using a conformal mode of proton beam irradiation, a total dose of 60-80 Gy was safely administered with acceptable morbidities. CONCLUSION: In the light of good complete response and survival rates achieved in the patients treated on Protocol-2, the combined treatment of definitive RT and IA administration of chemotherapy is considered as an effective bladder-preserving strategy
