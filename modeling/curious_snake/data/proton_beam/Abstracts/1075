A spreadsheet based program is presented to perform an independent Monitor Unit (MU) calculation verification for the Quality Assurance (QA) of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) using Dynamic MultiLeaf Collimation (DMLC). The computed dose value is compared to the planned dose by calculating the percent dose difference per Intensity Modulated Beam (IMB) and absolute dose difference per IMB. The proposed acceptability levels are +/-5.0% or +/-2.0 cGy for the percent dose difference per IMB and the absolute dose difference per IMB, respectively. For percent dose difference per treatment, an acceptability level of +/-2.0% is proposed. The presented program is considered adequate for checking the treatment plans calculated for IMRT treatments using DMLC as a part of the QA procedure
