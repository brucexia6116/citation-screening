Cultured HeLa cells have been irradiated with a single acute dose of either gamma rays (40 Gy) or low energy proton beams (20 Gy). 1H magnetic resonance spectra of perchloric acid extracts (PCA) prepared at different times after irradiation show an intensity decrease of signal from glutathione and a parallel increase of lactate signal. Intensity ratios of signals of glycerophosphorylcholine to that of phosphorylcholine increase with time after irradiation. Irradiating cells with gamma rays or proton beams at half a dose obtain effects of comparable extent. The present experiments indicate that relevant metabolic alterations take place in cells damaged by irradiation. Finally, these data represent a first indication that the relative biological efficiency of low energy proton beams with respect to gamma rays can reach a value of 2 as evidenced by cell metabolic impairment
