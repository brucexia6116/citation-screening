Germany has always deserved a great interest to electron beam radiotherapy (betatron, linear accelerator). At St. Vincentius Hospital in Karlsruhe the percentage of electron treated patients grew up in the years from 15% to 45%. Electron energies between 7 and 12 MeV are the most commonly used. Major RT Centres need a wider range of energies (5/7-20 MeV), but the minor ones should have at least electron beams of 5-12/15 MeV
