A noninvasive method for in vivo measurement of the oxygen concentration has been developed. By introducing a novel contrast medium (CM) based on a single electron substance, it is possible to enhance the proton signal through the Overhauser effect. A low-field magnetic resonance scanner is used to image the proton nuclei of the object. The electron spin transition of the CM is saturated using rf irradiation. As a consequence, the nuclear polarization becomes enhanced through dipole-dipole interaction. The signal enhancement is a function of rf power and of the EPR line width of the substance, which is influenced by the oxygen concentration. The maximum in vivo enhancement has been measured to 60. Image data, generated with different scanning parameters, is used in a postprocessing method to generate images showing pO(2) and the contrast medium concentration, respectively. The mathematical foundation of the postprocessing algorithm is outlined. The results from phantom experiments and animal experiments, in which the oxygen content of the inspired gas was varied, are presented. The potential for human imaging is discussed. J. Magn. Reson.
