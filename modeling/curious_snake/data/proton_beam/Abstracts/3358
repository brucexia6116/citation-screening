This was a non-randomized prospective study on the "sandwich" radiosurgical treatment of resectable rectal and rectosigmoid carcinomas. From December 1984 to December 1989, 100 patients were treated 86 of them are now evaluable. Mean follow-up was 38 months (range: 9-69). Surgery was abdomino-perineal resection in 33 cases and anterior resection in 53 cases. Radiotherapy was preoperative pelvic irradiation, with a single 500-Gy fraction, the day before surgery. To stages B2, C1 and C2 patients (Astler and Coller) postoperative radiotherapy was administered for a total dose of 4500 Gy (180 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/week), with box technique, from a Co 60 unit or Linear Accelerator (photon 18 MV). Preliminary results indicate 8% (7/86) local recurrences and 9.3% (8/86) distant metastases. Five-year actuarial disease-free survival is 63.2% +/- 8 for stage B1, 55.6% +/- 19 for stage B2, and 40.2% +/- 13 for stages C1 + C2. Overall 5-year actuarial disease-free survival is 53% +/- 10. No lethal or severe complications were observed following treatment
