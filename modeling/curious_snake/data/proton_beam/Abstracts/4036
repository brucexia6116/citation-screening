The efficacy of radiation therapy combined with local hyperthermia is demonstrated by three case studies. Mode of action and problems are discussed and published results reported. Human tumour cells obtained of biopsies from our patients before the onset of treatments were investigated. The short time cell cultures were treated either with hyperthermia or irradiation alone or with combinations under the same conditions as the clinical treatments. We could clearly demonstrate that cell cultures of human origin respond to irradiation or hyperthermia. But the effect was limited and only cultures treated with combined modalities did not relapse. There is hope that mega-voltage radiation complemented with hyperthermia have a similar effect as high-LET-radiation. Side effects have been moderate so far using an extended clinical use
