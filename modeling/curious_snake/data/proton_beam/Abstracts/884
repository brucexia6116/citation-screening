Total Skin Electron Therapy (TSET) was carried out using an electron beam with a nominal energy of 6 MeV. The beam was adequately filtered and angled in order to create dual fields. The uniformity of the dose distribution to the patient was 10%. The relative dosimetry of the dual beam was performed using a silicon diode and an ionization chamber in a standard water phantom. X-Omat V films were irradiated in a cylindrical PMMA phantom in order to obtain the dose distribution for the six TSET dual fields used in the treatment. Absolute dosimetry was carried out with a calibrated ionization chamber placed in a cylindrical water phantom. The dose contribution per monitor unit of the single dual beams was determined with this method
