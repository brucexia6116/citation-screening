Tumor treatment with charged particle beams is a quickly developing field aimed to translate the potential advantages offered by the superior physical dose distribution and relative biological effectiveness of heavy charged particles into a real improvement of tumor therapy. To this purpose the new proton and light-ion radiation therapy facilities must be designed according to strict clinical specifications to provide a reliable and effective tool against cancer. This paper provides the performance specifications of the accelerator and of the beam transport and delivery systems of the Italian Hadrontherapy Centre, which should be satisfied to meet the clinical specifications. A discussion is given on the requirements on energy range, energy variability, beam intensity, lateral penumbra, distal dose falloff, source-to-surface distance, time structure of the extracted beam, raster scanning system specifications, and beam abort time. Though the physical specifications are given for a particular accelerator, they can be used as a general guideline for the design of future biomedical particle accelerator facilities
