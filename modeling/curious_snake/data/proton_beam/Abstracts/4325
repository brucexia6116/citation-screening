A simple formula is evaluated for calculating the equivalent square collimator setting that gives the same headscatter factor as a given rectangular field. The expression requires that one parameter is determined experimentally. It is found that one single value of this parameter can be used for the six x-ray beams studied (two accelerators, two energies, with and without wedge)
