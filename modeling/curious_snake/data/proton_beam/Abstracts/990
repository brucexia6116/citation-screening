OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of treatment in 40 patients with primary tracheal carcinoma. METHODS: From 1970 to 2001, 40 patients with primary tracheal carcinoma treated in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-eight were male and 12 were female with median age of 47 years. The median interval from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 10 months (1 - 60 months). Fifteen patients had adenoid cystic carcinoma, 14 squamous cell carcinoma, 8 adenocarcinoma, 2 small-cell carcinoma and 1 mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Thirty-two patients received operation plus adjuvant radiotherapy, 6 received radiotherapy alone and 2 received operation alone. RESULTS: The median survival time for all patients was 40 months. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rate was 86%, 59% and 29%, respectively. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year local control rate was 84%, 60% and 50%, respectively. Distant metastasis rate in 1, 5, and 10 years was 17%, 51% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Surgical resection plus adjuvant radiotherapy is a reasonable mode of treatment. Despite late local recurrence after initial treatment, its intrinsic feature, excellent long-term palliation can be achieved after treatment
