The Laitinen Stereoadapter 5000 from Sandstroem Trade and Technology was acceptance tested and commissioned for clinical use in a Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy Program at our facility. The frame was implemented to function as a localization device for target delineation rather than as an immobilization device. The frame is of non-invasive nature utilizing ear plugs and a nasion bridge adapter as the connecting points with the patient's head. The reproducibility of the head frame position with respect to external skull reference points was tested. CT and MRI imaging studies were performed on a patient phantom with the stereoadapter in place. The target was delineated and target coordinates were calculated for two implanted targets. The phantom was positioned according to the target coordinates on a Siemens MXE Linear Accelerator by aid of the target positioning lasers. Radiographic port film images were taken with the circular fields typically used in stereotactic radiosurgery. A complete treatment isodose plan was performed and dosimetric accuracy was tested by positioning a small volume ionization chamber at the center of the target volume in the head phantom. The results of these tests were found to be clinically acceptable
