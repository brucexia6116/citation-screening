A pool of free amino acids was studied in blood and cerebrospinal fluid of 34 patients with adenoma of hypophysis before proton therapy and within 3 years after the treatment. The course of proton therapy was shown to cause a regression of the disease, a decrease in content of somatotropic hormone in blood as well as to normalize the metabolic pool of amino acids in blood and cerebrospinal fluid
