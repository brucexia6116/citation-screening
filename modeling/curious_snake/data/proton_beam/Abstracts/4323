Protons have a finite range in tissue and can provide a better concentration of radiation dose in the tumor than conventional X-rays in certain situations. The development of optimized treatment plans for X-rays and protons followed by a comparative evaluation is one method of selecting tumor sites best suited for proton treatment. The preliminary results of comparative treatment planning for base of skull tumors and carcinoma of the prostate are discussed. These comparisons suggest a clinical gain for proton treatment of tumors in these locations. The clinical experience with fractionated proton treatment of several tumor sites is also discussed. The results of high dose proton treatment of chordomas and low grade chondrosarcomas of the base of skull is particularly promising: an actuarial 5-year local control of 78% has been obtained in 50 patients followed for a minimum of 22 months
