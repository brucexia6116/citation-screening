When a charged-particle track intercepts the chromatin fibre in DNA of mammalian cells, clustered damage is induced depending on the DNA conformation, local environment and track structure. Intra-track correlated DNA damage may have a higher probability of being mis-repaired or left un-repaired. Fragment size-distributions of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced in primary human fibroblasts by 240 kVp X rays and 238Pu alpha particles (110 keV.micron-1) were resolved using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). By monitoring DSB rejoining kinetics and changes in the fragment size distribution with repair time, the relevance of spatial association of DSBs in determining rejoining kinetics was investigated. Rejoining kinetics appeared bi-phasic and independent of the size of the DNA fragments for both radiation qualities, with high LET radiation-induced DSBs repairing more slowly. Results suggest that local complexity of individual DSBs, rather than spatial association with other breaks is more significant in the determination of rejoining kinetics
