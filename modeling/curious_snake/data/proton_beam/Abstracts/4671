INTRODUCTION: Radiotherapy is involved in several ways in the treatment of non-small cell bronchial carcinoma (NSCBC). BACKGROUND: Three dimensional radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, is current practice, radiotherapy with respiratory gating and with intensity modulation are being evaluated Developments in imaging allow more precise definition of target volume, and stereotactic irradiation and proton therapy are little used at present but very promising. VIEWPOINT: The level of local control of NSCBC remains unsatisfactory. The results will certainly improve in association with advances in three areas: chemotherapy, better dose escalation and more precise targeting of tumour volume. CONCLUSION: Improvement in the management of NSCBC depends on these new treatment modalities that are still being evaluated and improved, with the aim of obtaining a longer survival and a better quality of life with reduced toxicity and side effects.
