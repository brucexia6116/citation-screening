The sources of the induced activity from the d(48.5)+Be fast neutron therapy beam of the Harper Hospital superconducting cyclotron have been investigated. The distribution of activity in the treatment room was measured, and the levels of dose equivalent to the staff were established. Activation spectra were measured with a high purity RE-Ge detector. Peaks corresponding to 28Al, 56Mn, 24Na, 64Cu, 66Cu, and 187W were present in the spectra. The dose equivalents due to the induced activation were measured by means of an ionization chamber type survey meter at six locations in the room. Irradiations of 120 monitor units were given at 15-min intervals, thus simulating the clinical situation. The measurements were made between the irradiations. The highest levels were registered around the treatment head. Two patterns are clearly distinguishable in these measurements. A fast decaying component with approximately 2 min half-life can be ascribed predominantly to 28Al and a slow growing component reaching saturation after about 4-5 treatments is associated with the presence of 56Mn. For uniform treatment load the activation build-up in each location was similar every day of the week with minimal values measured after the week end shut down. Personnel monitoring is achieved with dosimeters capable of detecting an extended range of neutron energies as well as beta rays and photons. Correlation between the number of fields treated and the doses to the radiation therapy technologists was shown. The mean dose equivalent received by the therapists is 7.1 +/- 0.2 microSv per treatment field. Means of reducing personnel dose equivalent levels are proposed
