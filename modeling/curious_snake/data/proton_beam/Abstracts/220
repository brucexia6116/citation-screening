During space travel, astronauts will be exposed to protons and heavy charged particles. Since the proton flux is high compared to HZE particles, on average, it is assumed that a cell will be hit by a proton before it is hit by an HZE ion. Although the effects of individual ion species on human cells have been investigated extensively, little is known about the effects of exposure to mixed beam irradiation. To address this, we exposed human epithelial cells to protons followed by HZE particles and analyzed chromosomal damage using the multicolor banding in situ hybridization (mBAND) procedure. With this technique, individually painted chromosomal bands on one chromosome allowed the identification of intra-chromosomal aberrations (inversions and deletions within a single painted chromosome) as well as inter-chromosomal aberrations (translocation to unpainted chromosomes). Our results indicated that chromosome aberration frequencies from exposures to protons followed by Fe ions did not simply decrease as the interval between the two exposures increased, but peak when the interval was 30 min
