Further to the description of the stationary-field irradiation with ultra-hard X-radiation (first communication) the planning of a moving field therapy is now discussed. The authors give simple criteria how to choose as exactly as possible the dose distribution adequate to the clinical plan among the available isodose plots. The indication of the necessary equipment parameters in facilitated by an irradiation table containing the average length of the moving beam. Test measures taken since 1974 on the linear accelerator Philips SL 75/10 show how good the scanning of a certain sector is reproducible
