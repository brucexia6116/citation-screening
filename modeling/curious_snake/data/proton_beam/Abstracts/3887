The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) worked out international standards for requirements and tests of electrical, mechanical and radiation safety as well as for definition and tests of functional performance characteristics of radiotherapy equipments (medical electron accelerators, gamma beam teletherapy and afterloading equipments, simulators and accessories) and for clinical dosimeters and terminology for medical radiology. A survey is given on the actual state of standardization projects. The problems of such standards are shown for the standard for functional performance characteristics of medical electron accelerators as example
