A stereotactic irradiation (STI) system using a linear accelerator was developed and its effectiveness for brain metastasis was investigated. The system consisted of a conventional linear accelerator, invasive fixation head frame (RADFRAME, Mizuho Ika Kogyo), and a tungsten collimator. The RADFRAME was developed to be used with any linear accelerators and with any dose planning systems. The accuracy of the irradiation was assured to be within +/-1.5mm. Fifty-one patients with metastatic brain tumors were treated using the system. The overall median survival time was 10 months. No difference in survival was observed between patients with a single lesion and patients with two or three lesions. Complete, partial, and minimal responses were obtained in 16 (39%), 18 (41%), and 7 (16%) lesions. These were comparable to the reported results of gamma knife treatment. A maximum dose of 25 Gy was suggested to be more effective than lower doses. Local control rate was higher in tumors with a diameter of less than 2.0cm (87.5%) than in larger tumors (60%). No difference in tumor response was observed among various histopathologic types. In a patient with a 25mm cerebellar metastasis from an adenocarcinoma of the lung, autopsy at 5 months after STI showed fibrinoid degeneration and hyaline deposition without residual tumor at the Gd-enhanced region on MRI. The efficacy of linac stereotactic irradiation was equal to that of gamma knife radiotherapy for metastatic brain tumors
