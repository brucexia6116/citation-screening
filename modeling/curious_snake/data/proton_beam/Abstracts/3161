From 1984 to 1990 38 patients had an operation for carcinoma of the gallbladder and bile ducts. The unfavorable prognosis of this type of cancer was improved by a combined treatment, consisting of surgical tumor reduction and implantation of a transhepatic drainage, followed by external radiation and intracatheter brachytherapy.
