Reverse-biased silicon p-n junction arrays using Silicon-On-Insulator technology have been proposed as microdosimeters. The performance of such detectors in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is discussed. This work provides the first reported measurements using boron-coated silicon diode arrays as microdosimeters in BNCT. Results are in good agreement with measurements with gas proportional counters. Various boron-coating options are investigated along with device orientation effects. Finally, a 235U coating is tested to simulate the behavior of the device in a heavy-ion therapy beam
