A beam-spot camera for measurements of x-ray focal spots of accelerators has been evaluated. The device consists of closely packed 0.25-mm-thick lead and 0.25-mm-thick cardboard strips. It is placed on radiographic film with the lamellae parallel to the beam axis and an exposure made. The images were scanned with a microdensitometer. The results indicate that the broadening of the source intensity profile at half maximum is of the order 1 mm, which permits the use of the beam-spot camera for acceptance testing and quality control. Longer tails in the density profile limit the quantitative information that can be extracted from the images
