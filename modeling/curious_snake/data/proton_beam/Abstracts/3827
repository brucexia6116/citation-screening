Dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery is a radiosurgical technique based on a medium-energy isocentric linear accelerator and a stereotactic frame. The technique uses concurrent and continuous rotations of both the gantry (300 degrees, from 30 to 330 degrees) and the couch (150 degrees, from 75 to -75 degrees). It gives a uniform dose (+/- 5%) within the target volume and dose fall-offs outside the target volume comparable to those obtained from presently known radiosurgical techniques
