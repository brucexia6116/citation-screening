In cases where both the source and cell geometry are well known, track-etch dosimetry allows the potential for individual cell dosimetry. However, analysis of track-etch images is both tedious and time-consuming. We describe here several image processing tools that we are using in conjunction with a track-etch based irradiator. Briefly, cells grown on LR 115 (a track-etch material) are irradiated from below by a collimated, planar alpha-particle source. Prior to irradiation, images of the cells are obtained. A computer program reads each image and automatically determines the location of individual cells. Next, the algorithm automatically identifies the cellular and nuclear boundaries. Following irradiation, and after the cells have reached their biological endpoint (e.g., cell survival), the cell dish is etched and images are obtained of alpha-particle tracks. Using the characteristic background pattern in the LR 115, the etched images are spatially registered to the original images. These two sets of images are then superimposed to create a composite image of the cells and associated alpha-particle tracks. Incorporating this tool into our irradiation scheme will enable more efficient analysis of the large amounts of data that are essential in assessing biological endpoints
