The use of micro-computers for continuous control of the position of an ionizing radiation detector in space and dose rate using an analog-to-digital converter permits raising the accuracy of and lessening the efforts of obtaining dosimetric information on radiation fields of beta-beam units. Error of determination of the position of a detector in space was +/- 0.2 mm, that of relative changes of dose rate was +/- 0.2%
