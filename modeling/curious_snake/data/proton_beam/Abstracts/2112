BACKGROUND: This review article will focus on clinical results and limitations of proton beam irradiation. Possible technological, biological and medical perspectives will be addressed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 911 patients with limited stage prostate cancer were treated with proton beam irradiation at Loma Linda University between 1991 and 1996. Endpoints of this evaluation were biochemically no evidence of disease survival (bNED) as well as acute and late treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The bNED survival rate was 82% at 5 years. Among 870 patients evaluable for late toxicity the following late effects were observed: Grade 3/4: 0%, Grade 2 rectal: 3.5% and bladder: 5.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively short follow-up times it seems justified to conclude that proton beam irradiation of prostate cancer can improve bNED rates by 10% and decrease Grade 2 late effects by more than 10%. There were no Grade 3 and 4 late effects
