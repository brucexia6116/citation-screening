A new experimental setup for uniform alpha-particle irradiation of cells in vitro is described. The alpha-particle irradiator is based on a radioactive (212)Pb/(212)Bi source. In the experimental setup proposed, cells are grown directly on a polylysine-coated track-etch material that forms the base of custom-made cell dishes. Alpha-particle irradiation is done through the base of the dish. Immediately prior to irradiation, the cell dish is scanned under a microscope, and images of cells with the corresponding coordinates are saved. After irradiation and after the biological end point under study has been determined, the cell dish is etched to develop alpha-particle tracks in the dish base. A microscope image series of alpha-particle track images is obtained by accurately revisiting every original (preirradiation) cell position in the track-etched dish. The number of alpha-particle traversals of each individual cell is scored by mapping images of alpha-particle tracks onto the images of cells recorded prior to irradiation. The uncertainty of the alpha-particle hit determination is 0.9 microm. The procedure described thus presents a method for radiobiological experiments with absolute, rather than statistical, cell dosimetry
