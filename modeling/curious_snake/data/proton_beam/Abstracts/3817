Assessment of electron beam energy and its long term stability is part of standard quality assurance practice in radiation oncology. Conventional depth-ionization or depth-film density measurements are time consuming both in terms of data acquisition and analysis. A procedure is described utilizing ionization measurements at two energy specific depths. It is based on a linear relationship between electron beam energy and its practical range. Energy shifts within the range covered by the two measurement depths are easily resolved. Within a range of +/- 0.50 MeV (+/- 1.30 MeV) around the established mean incident energy of 5.48 MeV (20.39 MeV), the method accuracy is better than 0.10 MeV
