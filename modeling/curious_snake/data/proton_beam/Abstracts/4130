BACKGROUND: Thorotrast, a radiological contrast medium that was widely used from 1928-1955 is a thorium dioxide colloid that has been neutralized and stabilized by colloid, composed of dextran. The major site of deposition is the reticuloendothelial system where it is retained for a long time. CASE REPORTS: Complications occurring late after exposure to thorotrast are described in two patients. RESULTS: One patient had angiosarcoma of liver metastatic to bone and bone marrow failure after a 43 year latency period. The other patient had a thorotrast granuloma and angiosarcoma of the liver after 22 year and 28 year latency periods respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Complications due to thorotrast appear to represent consequences of chronic alpha irradiation
