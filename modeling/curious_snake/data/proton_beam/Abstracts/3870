The yields of unstable chromosome aberrations induced in human lymphocytes by alpha-particles from plutonium-239 have been measured. Plutonium citrate solution was mixed with heparinized blood so that doses of 13--160 rad were delivered in 24 hours. Dicentric aberration yields (Y) fitted best to the linear expression Y = 3 . 72 +/- 0 . 23 x 10(-3) rad-1. Inclusion of a 6 . 5 rad point resulting from a 1 . 7 hour irradiation raised the yield coefficient insignificantly to 3 . 75 +/- 0 . 24 x 10(-3). The aberration yields are in good agreement with data from curium-242 alpha-particles obtained in this laboratory but they are much lower than those obtained in two other laboratories. Reasons for this disagreement are examined
