BACKGROUND: Head and neck tumors are often located near critical organs, making it impossible to deliver a dose of conventional radiotherapy high enough to eradicate the disease. Our aim was to review the potential benefits and available clinical experience of particle beam therapy (hadrontherapy) in the treatment of these tumors. METHODS: A review of the literature was carried out through a MEDLINE search (publications between 1980 and 2005). RESULTS: A review of the available clinical data shows that particle beam therapy can offer several radiobiological and physical advantages over conventional photon radiotherapy: improved dose distribution permits dose escalation within the target and optimal sparing of normal tissue. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that there may be benefits to using hadrontherapy for tumors characterized by poor radiosensitivity and critical location. At present, the most used hadrons are protons and, as yet on an experimental basis, carbon ions. It is now well accepted that there are certain indications for using proton therapy for skull base tumors (chordoma and chondrosarcoma), paranasal sinus carcinomas, selected nasopharyngeal tumors, and neutron/ion therapy for salivary gland carcinomas (in particular, adenoid cystic tumors). Its viability in other cases, such as locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and bone sarcoma, is still under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Hadrontherapy can be beneficial in the treatment of tumors characterized by poor radiosensitivity and critical location. Further clinical and radiobiological studies are warranted for improved selection of patient population. [References: 80]
