Pb(p, xn) thick target excitation functions were measured in the energy range 10-38 MeV in order to optimize the production of isotopically pure radiobismuth from natPb, 206Pb, and 207Pb. Additionally, the decay of Po-isotopes from deuteron irradiation of natural bismuth (209Bi) was exploited for radiobismuth production. 205Bi was produced from 206Pb at 20 MeV with only 2% of 206Bi at 4 weeks post irradiation. Bismuth compounds as used in the treatment of peptic ulcer were labeled with 205Bi for absorption studies in animals and subjects
