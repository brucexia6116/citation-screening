Heavy particle (ion) beams are characterized by high relative biological effectiveness and improved dose distribution. To establish heavy ion therapy for prostate cancer, three trials have been conducted. For 247 patients with T1b-T3 cancer, carbon ion beam was irradiated 20 times/5 weeks with or without endocrine therapy. Overall and cause-specific survivals were excellent and local control was achieved in all patients except one. Grade 3 late morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra was developed in 7 cases who received higher dose. Thus, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment. In conclusion, carbon ion therapy is expected to exert excellent effect in the treatment of localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. [References: 19]
