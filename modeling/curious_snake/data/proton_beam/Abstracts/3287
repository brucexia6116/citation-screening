The paper discusses the results of a study on the blood-serum levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin in 29 patients with an extensive breast cancer before and within 3 years after a combination therapy including proton "hypophysectomy". A correlation was established between the blood level of alpha 1--antitrypsin and the subclinical stage of generalized metastatic spreading. Consequently, the assay of the level of this inhibitor is suggested as another test for assessment of the efficacy of treatment of such patients and prediction of the results
