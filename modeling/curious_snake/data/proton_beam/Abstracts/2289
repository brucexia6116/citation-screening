Computer simulations of nuclear reactions by protons in a human body were carried out at the incident energies of 250, 300 and 500 MeV. About 20% of the incident protons are absorbed by the body with nuclear interactions and the rest of the protons pass through the body at these energies. Radiation of gamma rays from the body and radioactivity of the body were estimated as a function of the time after irradiation with the proton beam
