This paper reviews existing data on bone marrow partial shielding in animal studies with reference to partial-body protection in space radiobiology and medicine. Analysis of reported data indicates the efficacy of the method to protect animals (including dogs) exposed to gamma-radiation and high-energy protons. Experimental findings that demonstrate the effectiveness of bone marrow partial shielding show that this method may be used for partial-body protection in space flight
