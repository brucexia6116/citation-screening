In a small clinic with a small patient base, the implementation of IMRT/IGRT should be slow, measured, and meticulous. Most radiation oncologists in the United States have had no formal training in IMRT/IGRT because the modalities are so new. Proper patient selection and a team effort among the clinician, physicist, dosimetrist, and therapist are thus all the more critical.The clinician in the small clinic can take comfort in remembering that the technologies are new, but the principles of good radiation medicine are not. With patient selection, a team approach, and publication of data and maturation of the literature, IMRT/IGRT will become the new standard of care in academic centers, large private clinics, and small clinics alike.
