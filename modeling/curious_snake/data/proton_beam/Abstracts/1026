BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In June 1998, proton-beam therapy of ocular tumors started at the Hahn-Meitner Institute Berlin, Germany. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate treatment outcome for uveal melanomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 245 consecutive patients with primary melanoma of the uvea were treated from June 1998 to April 2003 with a 68-MeV proton beam. In 96.2% of all patients, a uniform fractionation scheme was applied: single dose 15 CGE (cobalt gray equivalent), total dose 60 CGE on 4 consecutive days. Follow-up is available in 229 patients. RESULTS: At the time of median follow-up (18.4 months), local control is 96.4% and 95.5% at 3 years. Eye retention rate is 92.6% at 20 months (median follow-up) and 87.5% at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Proton-beam irradiation of uveal melanomas at the Hahn-Meitner Institute after the first 5 years of its initiation reveals local tumor control and eye retention rates in the range of other centers with larger experience. Delivering high treatment quality in hadron therapy from the beginning has been achieved
