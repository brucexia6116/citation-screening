At the low particle fluences of radiation to which astronauts are exposed in space, "non-targeted" effects such as the bystander response may have increased significance. The radiation-induced bystander effect is the occurrence of biological responses in unirradiated cells near to or sharing medium with cells traversed by radiation. The objectives of this study were to establish the responses of AG01522 diploid human fibroblasts after exposure to several heavy ions and energetic protons, as compared to X-rays, and to obtain initial information on the bystander effect in terms of cell clonogenic survival after Fe ion irradiation. Using a clonogenic survival assay, relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values at 10% survival were 2.5, 2.3, 1.0 and 1.2 for 1 GeV/amu Fe, 1 GeV/amu Ti, 290 MeV/amu C and 1 GeV/amu protons, respectively, compared to 250 kVp X-rays. For induction of micronuclei (MN), compared to the low LET protons, Fe and Ti are very effective inducers of damage, although C ions are similar to protons. Using a transwell insert system in which irradiated and unirradiated bystander cells share medium but are not touching each other, it was found that clonogenic survival in unirradiated bystander cells was decreased when irradiated cells were exposed to Fe ions or X-rays. The magnitude of the decrease in bystander survival was similar with both radiation types, reaching a plateau of about 80% survival at doses of about 0.5 Gy or larger
