In the review which is a brief account of more complete document (Koterov A.N. // Int. J. Low Radiat. 2005. V. 1. No. 4. P. 376-451) the data of world researches devoted to a phenomenon of radiation-induced genomic instability (RIGI) are considered. The purpose of the review is the definition of the bottom limit of radiation doses which induced of RIGI in experiments at different methodical approaches (irradiation in vitro, in vivo, in utero, bystander effect and transgeneration effects of radiation). The action only radiation with low LET is examined. Among several hundreds works wasn't revealed any fact, when RIGI induced by low doses irradiation (up to 0.2 Gy) for normal cells and for organism left from maternal womb. Six exceptions are revealed which are named as "apparent" so in all cases the abnormal, unstable, defective objects or ambiguous final parameter were used. Thus, RIGI at low doses of radiation with low LET is a myth. [References: 94]
