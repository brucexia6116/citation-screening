Patient and internal organ motion during treatment with a scanned proton beam can introduce unplanned heterogeneities in the dose distribution throughout the irradiated volume. With static beam techniques, a margin around the target volume is added to compensate for patient and organ motion. This margin may not provide the solution with dynamic beam scanning. Intrafractional motion parallel and perpendicular to the beam axis is studied using two different scanning methods on a cubic water phantom. The direction of motion relative to the beam scanning direction as well as the method of scanning the proton beam across the target has a significant effect on the resulting dose distribution within the target volume. In the extreme cases studied here up to 100% of the target receives a dose outside the recommended limits, with a minimum dose as low as 34% of the prescribed dose
