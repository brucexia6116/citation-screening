PURPOSE: A new method of measuring photoneutron dose to the patient during treatment with high energy photon or electron beams is presented. This method has the advantage of providing not only the dose, but the microdosimetric spectrum at the same time. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A miniature cylindrical gas proportional counter (0.5 mm diameter by 0.5 mm height) has been used to measure scatter radiation from a 20 MV teletherapy photon beam. At atmospheric pressure, filled with propane base tissue equivalent gas, this counter simulates a unit density tissue region of approximately 0.9 microns. We present here single event microdosimetric spectra measured outside the primary beam 1.4 m from the target. This technique allows a single measurement to determine the scattered dose due to gammas and photoneutron contamination, as well as the quality factor of the photoneutrons. RESULTS: Spectral components from scattered photons and the photoneutrons are easily separated, and dose contributions can be estimated. The ratio of photoneutron dose measured by the proportional counter to photon dose at isocenter is 0.75 x 10(-4). CONCLUSIONS: Neutron dose was also measured using a bubble neutrometer. The proportional counter and neutrometer agree within experimental errors. This type of instrument is shown to be a viable technique for determination of exposure of patient and also personnel to photoneutrons, providing not only a dose determination, but also a spectrum that can be used to estimate quality factors for equivalent dose. Its main drawback is that it requires a lengthy (several hours) measurement because of low count rate of the neutrons
