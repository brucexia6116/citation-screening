In 31P-(1H) MR experiments of humans in a 1.5-T whole-body system, signal intensity enhancements of 31P resonances of up to 68 +/- 4% (for phosphocreatine of the calf muscle) have been observed upon irradiation at proton frequency. This observation is explained as a nuclear Overhauser effect due to the dipolar coupling between 1H and 31P spins
