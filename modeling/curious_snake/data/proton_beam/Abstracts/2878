Body distribution of absorbed energy of ionizing radiation determines relations between the desired effect and associated radiation lesions. Common methods of photon radiotherapy are characterized by strong irradiation of healthy tissues. Accelerated protons enables an increase in gradient of doses between the radiation-exposed subject and adjacent tissues. It is thought valid to promote wider use of the new Russian proton accelerator for upgrading radiotherapy
