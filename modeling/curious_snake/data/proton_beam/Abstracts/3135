A quick method of calculating the dose-rate distribution in irregularly shaped beams is presented. This method is partly based on the Cunningham model. The proposed modifications make it possible to avoid the scatter functions in favor of direct use of tissue-phantom ratios and field size coefficients. The problem has been evaluated for photons generated by 10 and 23 MV linacs. The calculated dose rates have been compared with measured ones, and good accuracy has been achieved
