The high temperature ratio (HTR) method using LiF:Mg,Ti thermoluminescent dosemeters allows in addition to the measurement of absorbed dose, the evaluation of the biological effectiveness of radiation. In order to analyse the correlation of the measured parameter HTR and gentoxic endpoints irradiation of cell cultures and TLDs were performed in a 62 MeV proton beam. The gentoxic effects respectively the relative biological effectiveness RBE, show an excellent correlation with the HTR due to a similar dose and LET-dependent behaviour
