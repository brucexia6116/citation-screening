Synchrotron-generated x-ray beams for microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) are fixed in space, so three-dimensional treatment planning would require that a patient be secured to, and moved in a gantry between exposures. Two protocols for such movements are proposed: one for uniaxial opposing-fields cross-planar MRT, the other for biaxial orthogonal-fields co-planar MRT
