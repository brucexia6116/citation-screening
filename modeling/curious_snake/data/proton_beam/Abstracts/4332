Twenty-seven patients with squamous esophageal cancer underwent small volume, low-dose, concentrated radiotherapy followed by esophageal resection whenever possible (esophagectomy for tumors of the thoracic esophagus and esophagogastrectomy for tumors of the lower esophagus). Curative resectability was 70% (19/27) with 4 operative deaths (21%). Recurrence rate was 66% after a mean period of 16 months, and the failure pathway was nodal in 53% of the cases. Historical comparison of the data suggests that preoperative irradiation increases the curative resectability rate without changing the early recurrence rate or failure pathway. Tumors with deeper invasion of the esophageal wall, which benefit by preoperative irradiation, are probably related to greater nodal diffusion, which is partly outside of the volume that may be resected or irradiated
