Stereotactic radiosurgery is a method that applies a radiation dose to a limited and well-defined volume while the irradiation of adjacent healthy tissues is minimized. It is most commonly used in the treatment of intracranial lesions because the skull hardness assures the stable location of its contents. Treatment of the rest of the body has recently been proposed and carried out, using original immobilization systems. Stereotactic radiosurgery was first described in 1951 by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell who originally used X-rays and then high-energy protons as a source of radiation. In the '80s photons from linear accelerators were used as radiation source, with various stereotactic systems and computerized treatment planning. The method used with all radiosurgical systems, regardless of the source of irradiation, is similar. The lesion is detected with common diagnostic imaging and adequate location frames. At present, to prevent errors in location, MRI and CT data are matched using an Image Fusion computer program. The objective of stereotactic radiosurgery is to destroy tumor cells or to induce changes in tissues that, as in brain arteriovenous malformations lead to the occlusion of their abnormal vessels. Stereotactic radiosurgery is increasingly used today in the treatment of a variety of intracranial lesions to the patients' benefit
