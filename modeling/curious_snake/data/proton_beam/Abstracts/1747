The aim of this work is the in vitro study of the late effects of single proton irradiation on HTB63 human melanoma cell growth, cell cycle and cell death. The experimental conditions were focused on analyzing the effects of irradiation on the periphery of tumour that can be, in clinical practice, close to critical organs. Confluent cell monolayers were irradiated with single doses ranging from 1 - 20 Gy, using proton beams having an energy of 22.6 MeV at the target. Antiproliferative effect of protons, cell cycle analysis and initiation of cell death, were followed 48 hours after irradiation. The inhibition of melanoma cell growth was observed, especially after single application of 12 and 16 Gy. Cell cycle analysis and cell viability have shown the G2/M and G1/G0 arrest of irradiated cells correlating with the increase of the applied dose. The flow cytometric analysis has shown presence of apoptotic nuclei. These data demonstrate that irradiation with protons, under the chosen experimental conditions, have significant effects on melanoma cell growth inhibition being dose dependent, G2/M cell cycle arrest and appearance of apoptotic nuclei, even 48 hours after irradiation. The results obtained may help the understanding of the relationship between cell proliferation, death and cell cycle regulation of melanomas after proton irradiation
