During the assembly of the prototype Clinac 2500, a unique opportunity arose to measure the cumulative total neutron yield of the machine as the major subassemblies were added, section by section. Differentiation of the results led to an inventory of the relative strength of the several neutron sources identified. The method utilized the fact that the scattered neutron fluence in a cavity in concrete is nearly uniform throughout the space and proportional to the fast neutron source strength. When normalized to the neutron output of the guide with bend magnet vacuum chamber, the relative neutron source strengths found were target, 1.9; primary collimator, 2.4; steel filter, 0.6; tungsten filter, 1.5; and jaw system, 0.8 open and approximately 2.0 closed. There is reasonable agreement between these measurements and published estimates of the yields from the major components of the treatment head
