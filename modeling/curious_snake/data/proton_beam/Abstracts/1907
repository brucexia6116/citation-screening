Neutron capture synovectomy (NCS) has been proposed as a possible treatment modality for rheumatoid arthritis. Neutron capture synovectomy is a two-part modality, in which a compound containing an isotope with an appreciable thermal neutron capture cross section is injected directly into the joint, followed by irradiation with a neutron beam. Investigations to date for NCS have focused on boron neutron capture synovectomy (BNCS), which utilizes the 10B(n,alpha)7Li nuclear reaction to deliver a highly localized dose to the synovium. This paper examines the feasibility of gadolinium, specifically 157Gd, as an alternative to boron as a neutron capture agent for NCS. This alternative modality is termed Gadolinium Neutron Capture Synovectomy, or GNCS. Monte Carlo simulations have been used to compare 10B and 157Gd as isotopes for accelerator-based NCS. The neutron source used in these calculations was a moderated spectrum from the 9Be(p,n) reaction at a proton energy of 4 MeV. The therapy time to deliver the NCS therapeutic dose of 10000 RBE-cGy, is 27 times longer when 157Gd is used instead of 10B. The skin dose to the treated joint is 33 times larger when 157Gd is used instead of 10B. Furthermore, the impact of using 157Gd instead of 10B was examined in terms of shielded whole-body dose to the patient. The effective dose is 202 mSv for GNCS, compared to 7.6 mSv for BNCS. This is shown to be a result of the longer treatment times required for GNCS; the contribution of the high-energy photons emitted from neutron capture in gadolinium is minimal. Possible explanations as to the relative performance of 157Gd and 10B are discussed, including differences in the RBE and range of boron and gadolinium neutron capture reaction products, and the relative values of the 10B and 157Gd thermal neutron capture cross section as a function of neutron energy
