Between 1976 and 1987, 52 patients with tumors adjacent to and/or involving the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spinal cord were treated with charged particles at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The histologies included chordoma and chondrosarcoma (24 pts), other bone and soft tissue sarcoma (14 pts), and metastatic or unusual histology tumors (14 pts). Radiation doses ranged from 29 to 80 Gray-equivalent (GyE), with a median dose of 70 GyE. Twenty-one patients received a portion of their treatment with photons. Median followup was 28 months. For 36 previously untreated patients, local control was achieved in 21/36 patients and the 3-year actuarial survival was 61%. Of 16 patients treated for recurrent disease, 7/16 were locally controlled and the 3-year actuarial survival was 51%. For patients treated for chordoma and chondrosarcoma, probability of local control was influenced by tumor volume (less than 100 cc or greater than 150 cc) and whether disease was recurrent or previously untreated. Complications occurred in 6/52 patients, including one spinal cord injury, one cauda equina and one brachial plexus injury, and three instances of skin or subcutaneous fibrosis. Charged particle radiotherapy can safely deliver high tumor doses to paraspinal tumors with good local control
