A technique for stereotactic radiation therapy of cerebral tumours and arteriovenous malformations using a linear accelerator (6 MV photons) is proposed. Treatment relies on a fixation system that permits a precise use of the coordinates estimated at stereotactic angiography or stereotactic computed tomography. The field of treatment can be exactly outlined in the CT images during repeat examinations, thus facilitating the recognition of changes induced by radiation. The system also allows the extent of the arteriovenous malformation, as seen at angiography, to be accurately traced in the CT sections thus enabling evaluation of possible radiation damage to surrounding brain structures. The precision of the method as well as its hypothetical merits and disadvantages are discussed. The number of patients treated is still small and the follow-up time is too short in the majority of cases to allow definite conclusions. Examples of preliminary results are given
