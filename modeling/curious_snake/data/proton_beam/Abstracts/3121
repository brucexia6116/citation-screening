A convenient method of 77Kr production has been developed for its routine medical use in cerebral blood flow measurement. An aqueous solution of NaBr (40 wt%) was used as the target and 77Kr produced by the 79Br(p, 3n)77Kr reaction was rapidly recovered from the target under a He stream. The optimal target thickness was determined to be 5 approximately 6 mm by investigating radionuclidic purity and proton current effect on the yield. About 740 MBq (20 mCi) of 77Kr with a radionuclidic purity of 92% was obtained within 5 min after a 5 microA-20 min irradiation. The present method has been demonstrated to be suitable for routine 77Kr production
