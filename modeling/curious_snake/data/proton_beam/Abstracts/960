Induced activity due to photonuclear reactions produced in the vacuum window of the accelerating wave-guide, the x-ray target and the beam-flattening filter of an 18 MV Siemens KDS linac has been studied. Measurements were performed using a high-purity portable germanium detector. Radioisotopes such as 196Au, 57Co, 60Co and other traces were detected one week after the last clinical use of the linac
