A group of Swedish oncologists and hospital physicists have estimated the number of patients in Sweden suitable for proton beam therapy. The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. It is estimated that in paediatric cancers, proton beams are of potential importance in 80-100 children annually in Sweden. About 20 of the patients have medulloblastoma. The main purpose is to reduce late sequelae, but these are also increased chances to avoid myelosupression during e.g. concomitant chemo-radiation and to further intensify the chemotherapy.
