Using a CT-based, 3-D treatment planning system and Beam's Eye-View (BEV) displays, shaped fixed-field techniques have been developed for external beam boost treatment of Stage C carcinoma of the prostate. The basic technique comprises three sets of opposing beams (laterals and +/- 45 degrees with respect to the lateral) into a 6-field arrangement. Target volumes together with bladder and rectal wall volumes are outlined on axial CT slices and combined to form 3-D volumes. For each field, an interactive BEV display is produced showing the target volume in its correct 3-D geometrical perspective and an auto-block routine is used to design focused blocks which conform to that volume. Full 3-D volume calculations computed for those plans on 17 patients were analyzed along with similar calculations for more traditional unblocked 4-field box and bilateral arc techniques. Compared to the 95% isodose volume for the 6-field conformational technique, traditional open beam full target coverage techniques typically produce high dose volumes which cover up to five times as much uninvolved tissue. Dose volume histograms illustrate that typically half as much bladder and rectal tissue is treated to high dose using the conformational boost techniques. From the dosimetric perspective of sparing normal tissues, shaped fixed-field boost techniques are shown to be clearly superior to traditional full coverage bilateral arc techniques. Smaller 8 cm X 8 cm arc techniques are shown to be quantitatively unacceptable for treatment of this advanced stage disease, as they typically misses 20-35% of the target volume
