To increase the quality of radiotherapy a verify and record system (VPS) was developed for teletherapy equipments, that takes control of manually adjusted irradiation parameters and of recording all relevant data of radiotherapy. The VPS can be adapted to special wishes of the user and it lends itself to application on different irradiation equipments. In the represented paper especially the extent of efficiency of the system is shown which is characterized by high operating comfort, flexible reacting to exceptional cases and by high date and operating security. The testing phase on an accelerator model has been brought to a close, actually the system is installed to an electron linear accelerator "Neptun 10p" and led to clinical trial
