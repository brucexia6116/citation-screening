Small-field radiotherapy based on a 6-MeV linac and a conventional head mold is investigated as an alternative to radiosurgery with stereotactic frames. The system requires no additional device and allows fractionated treatment. The dose distributions obtained are comparable to those reported with a Gamma Unit. Overall positioning errors are within 2 mm. Using this approach, seven patients with brain tumors who could not have been treated otherwise, underwent fractionated radiotherapy with total accumulated doses ranging from 70 to 108 Gy. The treatment was tolerated well with no acute toxicity or adverse effect encountered during the follow-up period of 8-14 months. All of the patients remained free from disease progression in the treated volumes. Although the follow-up is brief, the preliminary results suggest that this is a simple and inexpensive but effective system for the treatment of small intracranial malignancies
