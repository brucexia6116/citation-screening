OBJECTIVE: Although radiation therapy is used in early-stage inoperable lung cancer, it often results in injury to functional lung tissue. A study was undertaken to determine the frequency and severity of pulmonary injury revealed by CT in patients who had undergone conformal proton (to a limited volume) radiation therapy. We compared these findings with those from a group of patients who had undergone a combination of photon and conformal proton (to a larger volume) radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: Proton radiation therapy was associated with a lower frequency of pulmonary injury than the combined regimen. Injury correlated well with the volume of normal lung that was irradiated. Conformal proton radiation therapy appears to be able to reduce the incidence and severity of pulmonary injury revealed by CT
