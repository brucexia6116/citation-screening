The Monte Carlo technique and GafChromic films were employed to verify the accuracy of the dose planning system (Leksell GammaPlan) used in Gamma Knife (type B) radiosurgery when plugged collimator helmets were used. The EGS4 Monte Carlo code was used to calculate the dose distribution along the x, y, and z axes when a single shot was delivered at the center point (unit center point: x = 100, y = 100, z = 100) of a spherical polystyrene phantom, with gamma angle of 90 degrees. Two different sizes of the plugged collimator helmets, 4 and 18 mm, were studied. Two typical plugged patterns, 51 plugs and 99 plugs along the y direction, were examined. The results of our Monte Carlo trials showed good consistency with GammaPlan calculations and GafChromic film measurements. Furthermore, the Monte Carlo results showed that radiation leakage from the plugs was too small to affect the overall isodose curve distribution even when the heavily plugged pattern of up to 99 plugs was employed. The results of this project provide confidence to all Gamma Knife centers using the Leksell GammaPlan treatment planning system
