Based on quantum chemistry and chemical kinetics, the paper formulates basically new concepts of the possibility of controlling biochemical reactions in biological tissues by simultaneously making abnormal human visceral foci, in cancer diseases in particular, exposed to two rays via radiation and optic laser radiations. The paper also presents experimental findings of the channeling of X-ray and fluxes of charged particles along the fiber wave guides. It considers the circuit engineering of a medical endoscopic device that concurrently transmits optic laser radiation and fluxes of penetrating radiation into the viscera
