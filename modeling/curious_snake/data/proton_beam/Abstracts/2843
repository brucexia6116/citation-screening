The paper deals with a correlation between the rate of tumor regression in response to radiation and the results of radiation treatment of cancer of the uterine cervix. The period of 50% decrease in tumor size in response to radiation treatment was established in 116 patients with cervical carcinoma by means of a dynamical cytological examination. Acceleration of tumor regression was followed by an increase in 5-year survival rates. A reverse correlation was established between growth and regression rates of cervical carcinoma. Thanks to the determination of tumor regression rates, various modalities of radiation treatment could be evaluated in the course of therapy and their efficacy predicted
