This Clinic recently commissioned its first electron beams for radiation therapy. Over the past twelve months at this institution, we have developed devices and techniques to obtain precise and reproducible electron therapy treatments. These devices and methods have been used in the treatment of irregularly shaped fields for areas of complex shape, or those adjacent to critical or radiosensitive tissues and areas where it has been cosmetically unsuitable for patients to carry treatment field markings. This paper describes the techniques used in six representative cases with due consideration to physics, dosimetry and practical aspects. Several recommendations result from our experiences here
