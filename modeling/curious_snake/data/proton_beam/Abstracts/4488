A total of 106 patients were examined for adverse effects to the brain from 60Co or proton radiotherapy. Radiation induced change (RIC) developed within the irradiated field 40-60 months after doses of 800-1000 neuNSD or 70 TDF and in 10-20 months after doses of more than 1700 neuNSD or 100 TDF. The incidence of RIC increased significantly with increasing age. Furthermore pathological changes like oedema and infarction in the brain tissue may be an important factor for the development of RIC in the central nervous system (CNS)
