108 patients with T2 or T3 carcinoma of the bladder were randomised to receive either photon therapy or low- or high-dose 15 MeV neutrons. Fifty-nine patients received photon treatment, 20 low-dose neutrons (LDN) and 20 high-dose neutrons (HDN). Eight patients received a combination of photon and neutron therapy, due to machine breakdown, and one patient received only one exposure, due to intercurrent illness. The three-year survival for all groups was 43% but there was no difference in survival between the treatment groups. The complication rate in the photon group was low--minor 3%, major 5%. The complication rates in the neutron groups were higher--LDN 30% and 15% respectively, HDN 15% and 10% and combined 25% and 37%. Only six patients died of complications related to therapy--photons 2, LDN 1, HDN 1, combined 2. No therapeutic gain for neutron therapy has been found in this study
