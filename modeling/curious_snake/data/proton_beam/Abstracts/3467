Measurements designed to separate primary and various scatter components of central axis dose of the highest energy photon beam of the CGR Saturne 25 linear accelerator are described. This beam has an unusually large output variation with field size. The measurements are performed both in air and in a water phantom, with and without an aperture external to the collimator system. Results are presented in the form of relative output factors for different field sizes due to (i) flattening filter scatter, (ii) water phantom scatter, (iii) collimator backscatter into the monitor chamber, and (iv) collimator forward scatter onto the central axis. It is found that the flattening filter is the single largest scatter component, but that each of the other factors is significant in determining the output dose per monitor unit as a function of field size
