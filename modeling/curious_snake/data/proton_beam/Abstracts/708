Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) combines the advantages of targeted radiation therapy and specific immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies. RIT can be used either to target tumor cells or to specifically suppress immunocompetent host cells in the setting of allogeneic transplantation. The choice of radionuclide used for RIT depends on its distinct radiation characteristics and the type of malignancy or cells targeted. Beta-emitters with their lower energy and longer path length are more suitable to target bulky, solid tumors whereas alpha-emitters with their high linear energy transfer and short path length are better suited to target hematopoietic cells (normal or malignant). Different approaches of RIT such as the use of stable radioimmunoconjugates or of pretargeting strategies are available. Encouraging results have been obtained with RIT in patients with hematologic malignancies. The results in solid tumors are somewhat less favorable but new strategies for patients with minimal residual disease using adjuvant and locoregional treatment are evolving. This report outlines basic principles of RIT, gives an overview of available radionuclides and radioimmunoconjugates, and discusses clinical results with special emphasis on their use in hematologic malignancies including use in conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation.
