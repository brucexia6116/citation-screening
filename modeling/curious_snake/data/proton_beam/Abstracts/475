Although the highest radiosensitivity of cells in the M phase among the other cell phases, such as the G(1), S and G(2) phases, has been known, the exact mechanism of radiosensitivity in mitotic cells remains unclear. Recently, mitotic arrest caused by DNA-damaging reagents has been shown, and the molecular mechanism in the arrest has been discussed in detail. In this study, abnormal cell-cycle progression in the M phase was investigated when a single mitotic cell in each mitotic stage was irradiated with a 5.35 keV X-ray microbeam focused on the cell nucleus. An X-ray microbeam irradiation system installed at BL-27 in Photon Factory, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (HEARO, Tsukuba) was used. HeLa cells, genetically modified and expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged aurora kinase B, were used as irradiated samples in order to recognise the stage of each cell in the M phase. Thus, 10 Gy irradiation concentrated at the nucleus of a single cell elongated the cell-cycle progression in the M phase by delaying the metaphase/anaphase transition. The dose dependence of the elongation of the M phase was also examined. An irregular distribution of DNA in anaphase cells was observed after irradiation
