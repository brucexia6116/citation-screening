Monte Carlo (MC) techniques can be used to build a simulation model of an electron accelerator to calculate output factors for electron fields. This can be useful during commissioning of electron beams from a linac and in clinical practice where irregular fields are also encountered. The Monte Carlo code BEAM/EGS4 was used to model electron beams (6-20 MeV) from a Varian 2100C linear accelerator. After optimization of the Monte Carlo simulation model, agreement within 1% to 2% was obtained between calculated and measured (with a Si diode) lateral and depth dose distributions or within 1 mm in the penumbral regions. Output factors for square, rectangular, and circular fields were measured using two different plane-parallel ion chambers (Markus and NACP) and compared to MC simulations. The agreement was usually within 1% to 2%. This study was not primarily concerned with minimizing the simulation time required to obtain output factors but some considerations with respect to this are presented. It would be particularly useful if the MC model could also be used to calculate output factors for other, similar linacs. To see if this was possible, the primary electron energies in the MC model were retuned to model a recently commissioned similar linac. Good agreement between calculated and measured output factors was obtained for most field sizes for this second accelerator
