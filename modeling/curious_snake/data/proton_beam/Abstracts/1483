A multi-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (MFISH) assay has been developed, for simultaneous visualisation of all human chromosomes in 24 different colours. This assay is based on the simultaneous use of combinatorial labelling and ratio labelling, the so called combined binary ratio labelling (COBRA). This technique is used to study the spectra of chromosomal exchanges induced by X ray and neutrons in human lymphocytes. With X rays the dose-effect relationships for both dicentrics and translocations were linear-quadratic, whereas with neutrons these were linear. Among aberrant cells, average estimates of the minimum number of breaks was higher for neutrons than for X rays. Moreover, the induced chromosomal exchange patterns were more complex following neutron irradiation in comparison with X rays. COBRA-MFISH was found to have a greater resolving power over partial labelling for the accurate detection of complex translocations and insertions. With neutrons the frequencies of both were higher than those induced by X rays, and their relative proportions to the total frequencies were independent of dose. These data suggest insertions can be used as the 'signature' of high LET radiation
