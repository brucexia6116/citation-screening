Microbeam therapy is established as a general concept for brain tumour treatment. A synchrotron based x-ray source was chosen for experimental research into microbeam therapy, and therefore new simulations were essential for investigating the therapy parameters with a proper description of the synchrotron radiation characteristics. To design therapy parameters for tumour treatments, the newly upgraded LSCAT (Low energy SCATtering) package of the EGS4 Monte Carlo simulation code was adapted to develop an accurate self-written user code for calculating microbeam radiation dose profiles with a precision of 1 microm. LSCAT is highly suited to this purpose due to its ability to simulate low-energy x-ray transport with detailed photon interactions (including bound electron incoherent scattering functions, and linear polarized coherent scattering). The properties of the synchrotron x-ray microbeam, including its polarization, source spectrum and beam penumbra, were simulated by the new user codes. Two concentric spheres, an inner sphere, defined as a brain, and a surrounding sphere, defined as a skull, represented the phantom. The microbeam simulation was tested using a 3 x 3 cm array beam for small treatment areas and a 6 x 6 cm array for larger ones, with different therapy parameters, such as beam width and spacing. The results showed that the microbeam array retained an adequate peak-to-valley ratio, of five times at least, at tissue depths suitable for radiation therapy. Dose measurements taken at 1 microm resolution with an 'edge-on' MOSFET validated the basics of the user code for microplanar radiation therapy
