The carbon ion (C-ion) beams provide unique advantageous biological and physical properties in radiotherapy (RT) for malignant tumors. C-ion beams have a high relative biological effectiveness (RBE) resulting from the high linear energy transfer (LET). In terms of their physical characteristics, C-ion beams exhibit a spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) and make for a better dose distribution of the target volume by specified beam modulations. Between June 1994 and August 2005, a total of 2,371 patients with malignant tumors were registered in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II trials using C-ion beams generated at Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). In the initial dose-escalation studies, grade 3 or more late rectal complications had developed in some patients. However, the adverse effects were resolved because of the use of appropriate dose levels and modification of the radiation technique. C-ion beams can carry out hypofractionated radiotherapy with a large fraction dose and reduce the overall treatment times compared with conventional radiotherapy. They can also achieve better local tumor control even for radio-resistant tumors such as malignant melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and bone and soft tissue sarcomas with minimal morbidity to the normal surrounding tissues.
