Transmission factors for beam modifers such as wedges and blocking trays in dosimetry calculations are very common, but various methods have been used in measuring these factors. A systematic study to measure these factors as a function of field size and point of measurement was carried out. The beam modifiers were a blocking tray and the standard wedges supplied with a cobalt-60 unit and a medical electron accelerator (6- and 18-MV x rays). Several points of measurement were selected, using several depths: dmax, TG-21 calibration depth, 10 cm (wedge angle defining depth, ICRU), 15 cm and in-air (miniphantom), and various field sizes. The results show a small field size dependence in these transmission factors with more dependence found in the point of measurement
