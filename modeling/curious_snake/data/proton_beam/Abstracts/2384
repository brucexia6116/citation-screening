Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were irradiated for 24 h in vitro with plutonium-239 citrate. The dose response for micronucleus induction using the cytochalasin B blocking technique fitted well to a linear relationship. Comparison with published data from the same laboratory using X-irradiation, indicated an RBE of 3.6 for alpha particles at low doses
