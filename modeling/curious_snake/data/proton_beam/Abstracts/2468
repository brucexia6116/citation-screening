This paper presents the effects of proton beam therapy of 175 patients with tumors of the eye. Irradiation was performed with a narrow medical proton beam (Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics) with the energy of 70 MeV (Bragg's peak). The total dose was 6000-7000 rad, irradiation frequency was 5-6 sessions every other day. Irradiation was used to treat intraocular and orbital melanomas, melanomas an cancer lesions of the eyelid and conjunctiva. According to the WHO classification, tumors fell under the T2-T3N0M0 stage. The follow-up periods varied from 1 to 10 years (an average of 3.4 years). Complete tumor regression was observed in 45% of the cases, partial regression in 39%, and the absence of the effect in 16%. Twenty-two patients (12%) underwent enucleation due to progressive tumor growth (16 patients) or postradiation complications (6 patients). Hematogenous metastases within a period of 2-5 years following irradiation were noted in 4% of the cases. The results obtained indicated a high efficacy of proton beam therapy for large ocular tumors. The mortality rate from metastases following irradiation was lower than that following enucleation
