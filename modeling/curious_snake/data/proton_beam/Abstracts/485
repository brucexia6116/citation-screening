A simple model of homogenous chromatin distribution in HeLa-cell nuclei suggests that the track of an energetic ion hits 30 nm chromatin fibers with a mean distance of 0.55 mum. To test this assumption, living HeLa-cells were irradiated at the irradiation setup of the ion microprobe SNAKE using the ion beams provided by the Munich 14 MV tandem accelerator. After irradiation, the distribution of 53BP1 protein foci was studied by immunofluorescence. The observed 53BP1 distribution along the tracks of 29 MeV (7)Li ions and 24 MeV (12)C ions differed significantly from the expectations resulting from the simple chromatin model, suggesting that the biological track structure is determined by cell nuclear architecture with higher order organisation of chromatin
