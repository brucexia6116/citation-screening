During radiation therapy with an ion beam, the production of secondary particles like neutrons, protons and heavier ions contribute to the dose delivered to tumour and healthy tissues outside the treated volume. Also, the secondary particles leaving the patient are of interest for radiation background around the ion-therapy facility. Calculations of secondary particle production and the dose absorbed by water, soft tissue and a multi-material phantom simulating the heterogeneous media of the patient body were performed for protons, helium, lithium and carbon ions in the energy range up to 400 MeV u(-1). The Monte Carlo code SHIELD-HIT for transport of protons and light ions in tissue-like media was used in these studies. The neutron ambient dose-equivalent, H*(10), was determined for neutrons leaving the water phantom irradiated with different light ion beams. The comparison of calculated secondary particle production in the water and PMMA phantoms irradiated with helium and carbon ions shows satisfactory agreement with experimental data
