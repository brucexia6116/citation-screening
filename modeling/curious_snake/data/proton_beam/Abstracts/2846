Despite a very successful interdisciplinary therapy regimen for pediatric solid tumors dominated by surgery and chemotherapy, the role of radiotherapy might become again more important if new techniques will allow a better dose localization to the target volume combined with a better protection of the normal tissue. This characteristic is known for charged particle beams. In a field study based on German cooperative trials, the possibility of a charged particle radiotherapy to retroperitoneal tumors of childhood will be discussed regarding indications in risk groups and recurrences. Absolute patient numbers are estimated from the clinical experiences and the incidences of the diseases. A stepwise introduction of this new therapy modality is proposed
