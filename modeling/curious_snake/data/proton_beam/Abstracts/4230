High linear energy transfer (LET) particles are more efficient than sparsely ionizing radiations in inducing chromosomal aberrations, in particular complex rearrangements. We analysed R-banded chromosome rearrangements in human lymphocytes irradiated with several ions having a wide range of LET (31.3-1435 keV/micron). The frequency of chromosome breaks unrejoined or inferred from observed rearrangements, and of complex rearrangements induced by a single particle, increased with the LET up to about 100-150 keV/micron and seemed to level off for higher LET values. Additional study was focused on damage induced by oxygen ions of three different energies. Significant cell cycle delay, and multiple chromosome rearrangements and breaks were demonstrated using Giemsa and Fluorescence-plus-Giemsa stainings, coupled with chromosome painting. Damage increased with the fluence and the LET, but at the higher LET damage decreased for fluences > 10(7) particles/cm2. Cell death and G2 block might be involved in this phenomenon. Chromosome 1 painting exhibited a high frequency of breaks and complex rearrangements, which would not have been detected using a standard staining. Complex rearrangements were induced by as few as one particle per cell nucleus and may be considered as a biological fingerprint of high-LET irradiation
