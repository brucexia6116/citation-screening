Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the radioactivity distributions induced by therapeutic irradiation is at present the only feasible method for an in situ and non-invasive monitoring of radiooncology treatments with ion beams. The clinical implementation of this imaging technology at the experimental carbon ion therapy facility at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) at Darmstadt, Germany is outlined and an interactive approach for a PET guided quantification of local dose deviations with respect to the treatment plan is presented
