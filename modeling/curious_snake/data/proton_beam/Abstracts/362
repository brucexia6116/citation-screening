The purpose of this investigation was the verification of both the measured data and quality of the implementation of the add-on ModuLeaf miniature multileaf collimator (ML mMLC) into the clinical treatment planning system for conformal stereotactic radiosurgery treatment. To this end the treatment head with ML mMLC was modeled in the BEAMnrc Monte Carlo (MC) code. The 6 MV photon beams used in the setup were first benchmarked with a set of measurements. A total ML mMLC transmission of 1.13% of the 10 x 10 cm2 open field dose was measured and reproduced with the BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc code. Correspondence between calculated and measured output factors (OFs) was within 2%. Correspondence between MC and measured profiles was within 2% dose and 2 mm distance, only for the smallest 0.5 x 0.5 cm2 field the results were within 3% dose. In the next step, the MC model was compared with Gafchromic film measurements and Pinnacle(3) 7.4 f (convolution superposition algorithm) calculated dose distributions, using a gamma evaluation comparison, for a multi-beam patient setup delivered to a Lucytrade mark phantom. The gamma evaluation of the MC versus Gafchromic film resulted in 3.4% of points not fulfilling gamma <or= 1 for a 2%/2 mm criterion, the Pinnacle(3) 7.4 f versus Gafchromic results 3.8% and Pinnacle versus MC less than 1%. For specific patients with lesions of 8 cc and 0.2 cc, Monte Carlo and Pinnacle simulations of the plans were performed and compared using DVH evaluation. DVHs corresponded within 2% dose and 2% volume
