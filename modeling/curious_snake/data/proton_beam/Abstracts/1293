A semiempirical method for the description of the off-center ratios (OCR) at depth from linear accelerators is presented, which is based on a method originally developed for cobalt-60 (60)Co units. The OCR profile is obtained as the sum of 2 components: the first describes an OCR similar to that from a (60)Co unit, which approximates that resulting from the modification of the original x-ray intensity distribution by the flattening filter; the second takes into account the variable effect of the flattening filter on dose profile for different depths and field sizes, by considering the existence of a block and employing the negative field concept. The above method is formulated in a mathematical expression, where the parameters involved are obtained by fitting to the measured OCRs. Using this method, OCRs for various depths and field sizes, from a Philips SL-20 for the 6 MV x-ray beam and a Siemens Primus 23, for both the 6-MV and 23-MV x-ray beams, were reproduced with good accuracy. Furthermore, OCRs for other fields and depths that were not included in the fitting procedure were calculated using linear interpolation to estimate the values of the parameters. The results indicate that this method can be used to calculate OCR profiles for a wide range of depths and field sizes from a measured set of data and may be used for monitor unit calculations for off-axis points using a standard geometry. It may also be useful as a quality control tool to verify the accuracy of lacking profiles calculated by a treatment planning system
