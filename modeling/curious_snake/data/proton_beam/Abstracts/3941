Total body irradiations have been performed on 112 patients at the University Hospital in Basel since 1979. Total body irradiations are effected in order to prepare patients with leukemia for bone marrow transplantation. The irradiation technique with 4 MV X-rays is described. The patients are treated without lung-shieldings. The dose-measurements show an acceptable homogeneity. The applied technique is very easy in comparison with other centers. A main point is making the patient's position as comfortable as possible. The accuracy of dose-application and dose-distribution is considered clinically acceptable
