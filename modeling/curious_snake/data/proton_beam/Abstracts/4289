Radiation therapy, which has significantly been on progressed by introduction of high energy X-ray and gamma-ray machines, is reaching to a turning point in order to improve further the results of the treatment. The treatment with particle radiations, characterized by either the high energy transfer to the surrounding tissues or the excellent dose distributions, i.e. Bragg peak, are in clinical trials. The results up to date show that the locally advanced, and radioresistant cancers have been more successfully controlled by applying fast neutrons than use of x-rays and that the damage to the normal tissues was less in the proton therapy compared with the conventional radiations. It is suggested from this clinical trial that the effect of particle radiations be more enhanced when the heavy ions, i.e., Neon ions and Silicon ions, become available
