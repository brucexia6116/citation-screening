Fifty-six patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were staged by exploratory laparotomy. Twenty-eight of them received radiotherapy with 32 MeV Betatron and intracavitary radium. Twenty-one patients with Stage IB or IIA had a radical hysterectomy, five had post-operative pelvic irradiation, and two had primary exenteration. An overall 23.2% of patients had metastases in the paraaortic fields. Four patients with paraaortic node disease received extended field irradiation: 4500 rad in 5 weeks to paraaortic nodes. Two of them are alive and disease-free at 5.5 to 6.5 years
