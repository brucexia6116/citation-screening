Monoclonal antibody (mAb) OC125 detects the cell surface-antigen CA125, which is expressed in more than 80% of epithelial ovarian cancers but not in normal adult ovaries. Its high specificity and binding affinity makes OC125 a potential candidate for use in radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Initial biodistribution studies using radiolabelled specific mAbs have demonstrated significant increase in tumor uptake of dose as compared to radiolabelled irrelevant antibody. We report here an isodose comparison of the cytotoxicity of 131I-labelled OC125 F(ab')2, 131I-labelled nonspecific protein and external beam irradiation using a cesium-137 gamma source. Enhancement of cytotoxity due to the specific binding of the mAb could only be observed when a critical activity of 131I localized at the cell membrane. At a specific activity labelling of less than 4.1 mCi/mg, the antigen specificity of OC125 does not contribute to cell kill. Using a specific activity of 10.2 mCi/mg, the relative biological effectiveness of 131I-labelled OC125 (F(ab')2 was increased by a factor of 5 compared with external-beam X-ray therapy, and the specificity of mAb OC125 was found to enhance the cytotoxicity of the radioimmunoconjugate (RIC) by a factor of 2.7. This low value is in accordance with previously reported theoretical calculations for long range, low-LET isotopes and may be one of the reasons why RIT using 131I has severe limitations. In conclusion, it is necessary to maximize the specific activity of RICs with low-LET isotopes such as iodine-131 in order to maximize the ratio of the dose delivered specifically by membrane-bound mAb versus free-floating nonspecific protein
