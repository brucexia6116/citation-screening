Magnetization transfer contrast imaging is an MR technique that capitalizes on interactions between the protons of mobile and macromolecularly bound water molecules. Studies to date, conducted primarily on 4.7 T and 1.5 T MR systems, have yielded results unique from conventional T1- and T2-weighted imaging studies. In this study, performed on a 0.1 T device, a section of lower leg was imaged in 20 normal human subjects and one patient with muscular dystrophy, using both a standard 500/22 gradient-echo sequence and a 500/22 gradient-echo sequence combined with off-resonance radio frequency irradiation designed to elicit magnetization transfer contrast. Results of the two techniques were compared. Our findings suggest that magnetization transfer contrast imaging is feasible at 0.1 T, and that this technique allows reproducible tissue characterization and improves contrast between certain tissues
