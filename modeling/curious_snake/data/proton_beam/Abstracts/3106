A neutron irradiation facility was constructed at PARMS, University of Tsukuba to produce an ultrahigh energy neutron beam with a depth dose distribution superior to an x-ray beam generated by a modern linac. This neutron beam was produced from the reaction on a thick uranium target struck by a 500 MeV proton beam from the booster synchrotron of the High Energy Physics Laboratory. The percentage depth dose of this neutron beam was nearly equivalent to that of x-rays around 20 MV and the dose rate was 15 cGy per minute. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of this neutron beam has been estimated using the cell inactivation effect and the HMV-I cell line. The survival curve of cells after neutron irradiation has a shoulder with n and Dq of 8 and 2.3 Gy, respectively. The RBE value at the 10(-2) survival level for the present neutron beam as compared with 137Cs gamma rays was 1.24. The results suggest that the biological effects of ultrahigh energy neutrons are not large enough to be useful, although the depth dose distribution of neutrons can be superior to that of high energy linac x-rays
