The author proposed a method for calculation of the distribution of an absorbed dose of a fast neutron beam on Y-120 cyclotron in biological tissue. The method ensured the coincidence of the results with average experimental data with the accuracy no less than 3%, and could be used for dosimetric design of cancer therapy with fast neutrons
