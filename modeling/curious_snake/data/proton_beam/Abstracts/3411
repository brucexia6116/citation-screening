Little is known about radiosensitization produced by iododeoxyuridine (IUDR) with high linear energy transfer radiation. Likewise, the effect of IUDR on repair of sublethal or potentially lethal damage is unclear. A series of in vitro experiments was performed examining these aspects of IUDR radiosensitization. Human T1 cells were grown in the presence of 3.0 micromolar IUDR for 72 hours (approximately three doubling times), an exposure which resulted in minimal cytotoxicity to unirradiated cells. As the cells entered plateau phase they were exposed to X rays and a variety of heavy ion beams. Sensitization was found to decrease as linear energy transfer (LET) increased. No sensitization took place in an extremely high LET Lanthanum ion beam (1000 keV/micrometer). However, IUDR produced significant sensitization in the Neon ion beam currently used to treat cancer patients at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Sensitization enhancement ratios at the 40% cell survival level were found to be 1.8 for X rays, 1.5 for the proximal Bragg peak of the clinical Neon beam, and 1.3 for the distal peak of the clinical Neon beam. Cell survival curves fitted to the linear-quadratic model showed IUDR significantly increased the value of the linear component (alpha) in beams with LETs below 40 keV/micron. The value of the quadratic component (beta) was unaffected by IUDR, regardless of LET. Split-dose experiments with both X rays and proximal peak Neon ions revealed IUDR did not affect sublethal damage repair. Similarly, delayed-plating experiments showed IUDR did not affect repair of potentially lethal damage. In contrast to cells unexposed to IUDR, IUDR-treated cells showed near-equal levels of cell killing throughout the extended Bragg peak of the clinical Neon beam. These findings suggest that the addition of IUDR to Neon ion radiotherapy could enhance the therapeutic ratio of the clinical Neon beam
