A prospective study was carried out in order to assess whether the regression rate can be applied as a parameter, which could be correlated with the probability of recurrence after radiation of neck node metastases. Measurements were made on neck node metastases during the radiation treatment period in 47 patients. Tumors with a slow regression rate were shown to have a high probability of recurrence. The results indicate that accurate measurements of the regression rate provide prognostic information, which is obtained early enough for the radiotherapist to consider additional treatment
