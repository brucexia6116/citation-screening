Targeting of radiotherapy can be based on improving physical dose distribution of radiation delivered or on utilization of specific biological processes for targeting. Tools for physical targeting include brachytherapy, hadron therapy, conformal radiotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy, stereotactically guided conformal fractionated radiotherapy, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Biological targeting can be based on specific metabolic pathways such as uptake of iodine-131 by thyroid cancer cells, difference in substrate uptake between cancer cells and normal cells (e.g. boronophenylalanine in boron neutron capture therapy), targeting of radioactive isotopes by specific carrier molecules (radioimmunotherapy, labeled hormone derivatives or bone-seeking phosphonates), or on the distribution of elements in the body (therapy of bone metastases with a calcium analog strontium-89 or phosphorus-32).
