Three sets of 10 MV x-ray zero-area phantom scatter correction factors (Sp) have been obtained using three methods. The three methods are all based on the Bjarngard-Petti extrapolation principle. The three sets of data assume lateral CPE (charged particle equilibrium) for the primary absorbed dose. Using the most reliable set of data, a set of 10 MV x-ray SMRs (scatter-maximum ratios) is produced and parameterized. With respect to the zero-area Sp correction factor at a depth of 2.5 cm, the parameterized expression gives Sp (0; 2.5) = 0.931 and a Rice-Chin Monte Carlo simulation gives Sp (0; 2.5) = 0.927. The former is only 0.4% larger than the latter
