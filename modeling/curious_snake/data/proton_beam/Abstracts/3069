A doubly achromatic asymmetric three-magnet beam deflection system is described which is suitable for deflecting low energy electron linac beams with high energy spread through approximately 90 degrees. It consists of three dipoles: two small antisymmetric magnets and one approximately 90 degrees magnet. The doubly achromatic relations for the system are given. The configuration has the specific advantage over all other doubly achromatic systems of minimizing the magnet dimension in the direction opposite to the exit trajectory, and is particularly desirable in a high energy medical electron linac, for it reduces rotation radius of gantry of the machine
