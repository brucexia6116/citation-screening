Thirty-nine patients with primary or recurrent glioma of the brain were irradiated wholely or in part with heavy charged particle beams at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in a Phase I-II clinical trial of the Northern California Oncology Group. During the course of this trial, treatment techniques have been developed and tumor doses have been escalated in order to obtain data on normal brain toxicity and response of malignant glioma of the brain. Toxicity has been acceptable with a low level of brain injury. Survival and tumor control has been approximately the same as historical results in glioma of the brain. Further dose escalation is planned together with possible trial of combined modality therapy
