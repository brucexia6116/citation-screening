Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) is an emerging therapeutic modality, thought to be best suited to cancer micrometastases, leukaemia and lymphoma. TAT has not been indicated for solid tumours. However, several melanoma patients in a phase 1 clinical trial of systemic targeted alpha therapy for melanoma experienced marked regression of subcutaneous and internal tumours. This response cannot be ascribed to killing of all cancer cells in the tumours by targeted alpha therapy. These new observations support the original hypothesis that tumours can be regressed by a mechanism called tumour anti-vascular alpha therapy. This effect depends on the expression of targeted receptors by capillary pericytes and contiguous cancer cells, and on the short-range and high-energy transfer of alpha radiation
