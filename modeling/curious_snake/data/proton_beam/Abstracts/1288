Cell survival, mutations and chromosomal effects were studied in primary human lymphocytes exposed in G0 phase to a proton beam with an incident energy of 0.88 MeV (incident LET of 28 keV/microm) in the dose range 0.125-2 Gy. The curves for survival and mutations at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase locus were obtained by fitting the experimental data to linear and linear-quadratic equations, respectively. In the dose interval 0-1.5 Gy, the alpha parameters of the curves were 0.42/Gy and 3.6 x 10(-6) mutants/Gy, respectively. The mutation types at the HPRT locus were analyzed by multiplex-PCR in 94 irradiated and 41 nonirradiated clones derived from T lymphocytes from five healthy donors. All clones showed a normal multiplex-PCR pattern and were classified as point mutations. Chromosome aberration data were fitted as a linear function of dose (alpha = 0.62 aberrations per cell Gy(-1)). By irradiating G0 lymphocytes from a single subject with 28 keV/microm protons and gamma rays, an RBE of 6.07 was obtained for chromosome aberrations. An overinvolvement of chromosome 9 relative to chromosome 7 was found in chromosome breaks after chromosome painting analysis
