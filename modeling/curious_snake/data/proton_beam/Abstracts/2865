For obliquely incident photon beams, the buildup of dose with depth is markedly different from normally incident beams. However, relatively little data on this topic exists for high-energy photon beams of energy greater than 6 MV. Measurements of dose in the buildup region were made using a plane-parallel ionization chamber in a polystyrene phantom with obliquely incident 6-, 10-, 18-, and 24-MV x-ray beams angled 0 degrees to 84 degrees. Buildup curves at these angles were plotted and from these an obliquity factor, defined as the ratio of ionization charge collected at a point for a particular angle of incidence to that collected at the same point at normal incidence, was determined. For each energy, the obliquity factor as a function of depth, field size, and source-chamber distance was studied. Results indicate that the obliquity factor is highly dependent on the beam energy, angle of incidence, the collimator opening, and the source-skin distance. A mathematical expression has been developed to predict the dose in the buildup region of high-energy photon beams for various angles of beam incidence, field size, and chamber distance
