PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between cell killing and residual chromatin breaks after irradiation with qualitatively different types of radiation in six human cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six human tumour cell lines and normal human cells were irradiated with 200 kV X-rays and two carbon-ion beams accelerated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) differing in LET. At the sample position the carbon-ion beams had LET infinity values of 13.1 and 77.5 +/- 0.4 keV/microm. Cell inactivation was documented by a colony assay. Residual chromatin breaks were measured by counting the number of residual chromatin fragments at 24h, detected by the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) technique. RESULTS: The cell lines covered a broad range of radiosensitivity. D10 values ranged from 3.53 to 8.12 Gy for X-rays, 2.56 to 7.41 Gy for the lower LET carbon ions and 1.17 to 3.85 Gy for the higher LET carbon ions. The results for residual chromatin breaks indicate that the more radiosensitive cell lines showed a greater induction of residual chromatin breaks either by X-rays or carbon-ions, and that an X-ray resistant cell line also showed resistance to carbon-ions. Cellular radiosensitivity correlated with the frequency of residual chromatin breaks. CONCLUSION: The detection of residual chromatin breaks by the PCC technique could be used to predict cellular radiosensitivity among qualitatively different types of radiation
