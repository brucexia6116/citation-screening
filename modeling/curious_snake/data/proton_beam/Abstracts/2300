At least two fundamental requirements must subsist for every stereotaxic radiotherapy treatment: 1) a capacity to administer extremely high doses of radiation to small areas which have been precisely defined in three dimensions; 2) the presence of a steep gradient between adjacent isodose curves so that damage to the tissues close to the target may be reduced to the minimum. The authors have built a special stereotaxic device for the fixing of the head of the patient (together with the chosen intracranial target), once the indispensable neuroradiological evaluations and bioptic controls have been effected, at the isocenter of a linear accelerator (Varian Clinac 4). Once the dimensions of the collimator have been chosen in accordance with the volume and the three dimensional conformation of the target and the dose to be administered has been decided upon in accordance with the histological nature of the lesion, both the linear accelerator and the patient are rotated about the isocenter of the therapy unit. It this way it is possible to reach extremely high dosages with very steep isodose gradients, centered exclusively upon the target ("gamma knife"). The procedure employed is described in full. The dosimetric evaluations which preceded the use of the set-up in clinical practice are illustrated as well. The advantages that this technique offers when compared with interstitial brachytherapy and/or Leksell's radiosurgical procedures are stressed. The described procedure, which is entirely bloodless and thus applicable also to high vascularized lesions, has so far been used in a limited series of cases
