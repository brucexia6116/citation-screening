A scanning liquid-filled ionization chamber electronic portal imaging device (SLIC-EPID) and extended dose range (EDR2) films were used to evaluate transmitted dose profiles for homogeneous and inhomogeneous phantoms. Calibrated ionization chamber measurements were used to convert the pixel values acquired from the electronic portal images to dose. Because SLIC-EPID was developed to have a uniform response for all liquid ionization chambers, the off-axis dose values were reconstructed using a correction factor matrix, defined as the ratio of the relative EDR2 film and the corresponding EPID dose values measured in air. The transmitted dose distributions in the EPID detector layer were also modeled using a Pinnacle3 treatment planning system (TPS: Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA). The gamma function algorithm was then used to assess agreement between transmitted dose distributions measured using a SLIC-EPID and EDR2 film, and those calculated using the TPS. For homogenous and inhomogeneous phantoms, more than 90% agreement was achieved using gamma criteria of 2% and 3 mm and 3% and 2.5 mm respectively. Our results indicate that the calibration procedure proposed in the present study should be performed if SLIC-EPID is to be used as a reliable two-dimensional transmitted dosimeter for clinical purposes
