Human hepatoma and normal liver cells were irradiated with (12)C(6+) ion beams (linear energy transfer (LET) = 96 keV microm(-1)) and gamma-rays at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL). The numbers and types of chromatid breaks were detected using the premature chromosome condensation technique. Irradiation with (12)C(6+) ions produced a majority of isochromatid break types, while chromatid breaks were dominant for irradiation with gamma-rays. Experimental results showed that the initial level of chromatid breaks is clearly related to the absorbed dose from (12)C(6+) ions and gamma-rays. The (12)C(6+) ions are relatively more effective at inducing initial chromatid breaks when compared with the gamma-rays. A relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of about 2.5 resulted for the induction of initial chromatid breaks by (12)C(6+) ions relative to gamma-rays in both cell lines
