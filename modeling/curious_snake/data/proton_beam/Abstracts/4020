Apart from the classic combination of surgery and irradiation, four other treatment modalities are presently being evaluated in advanced head and neck tumours. These are: 1) antineoplastic chemotherapy 2) radiosensitizing agents 3) high LET radiotherapy 4)local hyperthermia Preoperative chemotherapy, followed by surgery and irradiation, has improved the local control as well as survival rates in phase II trials. Cis-platinum may yield some additional benefit due to its radiosensitizing properties. Radiosensitizing drugs such as nitro-imidazoles have so far failed to show any advantage in randomized trials, since neurotoxicity prevented maximum effective concentrations. The same is true for high LET radiotherapy with neutrons as compared to conventional irradiation. Local hyperthermia is considered as a palliation at the present time, when all other treatment modalities have been exhausted. In our centre, the preliminary results of radiotherapy and sensitization with cis-platinum in combination with surgery are encouraging. Some methods are discussed which permit the prediction of prognostic criteria for tumors under treatment. This may contribute to the optimization of individual treatment regimes in the future
