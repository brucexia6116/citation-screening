Stereotactic irradiation appears to be effective in causing partial or complete thrombosis of AVM that are not surgically resectable. Use of heavy particles generated in a cyclotron allows better spatial definition and dose distribution than do other methods, allowing larger AVM to be treated. From these preliminary results, it is evident that heavy-particle irradiation therapy, like proton beam therapy, does not offer protection from recurrent hemorrhage for at least 12 months, nor is it devoid of major complications; it does offer a noninvasive mode of therapy for AVM that are difficult to treat surgically, however
