The use of modern diagnostic facilities led to a study of the physico-dosimetric, topometric and clinical aspects of radiotherapy of oropharyngeal cancer. The most effective approaches to therapy of oropharyngeal tumors with account of their site, spread and degrees of differentiation were developed. The most effective method was shown to be the combination of gamma-beam therapy (50 Gy) with electron-photon radiation (20 Gy) of an accelerator of 18-20 MeV, radiation exposure of normal tissues being lowered by approximately 10-20% as compared to that in gamma-beam therapy used alone. The use of the above method in 45 oropharyngeal cancer patients resulted in an immediate clinical effect (disappearance of a tumor and regional metastases (if any) in 60% of the patients. The 2-year survival rate calculated by actuarial curves, was 62 +/- 10%
