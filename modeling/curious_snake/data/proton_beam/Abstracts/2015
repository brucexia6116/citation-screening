In natural aging of spirits or wine, the dynamic structure of ethanol-water clusters changes to a smaller and more uniform state. Through experience we know that naturally aged ones have higher metabolism than the non-aged ones. Also, the same effect as natural aging can be obtained in various types of spirits or wines by the treatment for a period of time with soft ultrasonic wave (US). In this study, we compared ethanol metabolism in human subjects dosed with non-treated white wine (control = CON) and with US treated wine. Ethanol levels in human sera were followed by 400 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy after administration of wine doses. Experimental results indicated that ethanol metabolism was enhanced 18% in subjects when US treated wine was used rather than when non-treated (CON) was used. Other experiments using rabbits showed that a 20% ethanol-aqueous solution was absorbed 18% more rapidly by the group dosed with US wine than by the CON group. From these experimental facts, it was theorized that ethanol metabolism depends on the rapidity of ethanol absorption in the human body. And it can be concluded that US treatment brings about the same effect on spirits or wines as natural aging
