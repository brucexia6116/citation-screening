The effects of diets prepared for prolonged space flights and stress exposures on peripheral blood of 42 healthy male test subjects was studied. The morphology of peripheral blood remained essentially unaltered, when test subjects were given dehydrated diets (freshly prepared, stored for 2 years and exposed to proton irradiation of a dose of 24,000 rad) or Salyut-6 space diet. Stress effects brought about neutrophil leukocytosis and lymphopenia which could be prevented with dietary supplements
