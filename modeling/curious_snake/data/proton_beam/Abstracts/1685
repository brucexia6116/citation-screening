Electroplated rhodium foil was employed as the target for cyclotron production of palladium-103. An electrodissolution apparatus was found better than other dissolution methods in terms of personnel shielding and palladium-103 yield. The ion-exchange column chromatography method was simple and effective for the purification of palladium-103 and the final stripping agent of NH4Cl + NH3(1:1) was more efficient than other agents
