The effect of air gaps under bolus material on the surface dose for electron beams is investigated. Dose measurements were performed for air gaps from 0.0 to 3.0 cm and bolus thicknesses of 0.5 and 1.0 cm using the various electron energies and cone sizes available on an electron linear accelerator. Our results show that the surface dose decreases for lower electron energies, smaller field sizes, thicker boluses, and larger air gaps
