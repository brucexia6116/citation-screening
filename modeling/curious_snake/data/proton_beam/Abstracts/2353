By means of preliminary results in the treatment of patients with acoustic neurinoma the achievable accuracies, dose distributions and time consumption of stereotactic LINAC-based convergent beam radiosurgery are compared to those achieved with fractionated stereotactic conformation beam radiotherapy. Characteristics of both techniques are described. With the Tubingen radiosurgery system a good adaptation of the dose distribution to spherical or oval target volumes with a steep dose gradient was achieved, whereas homogeneity and adaptation of the dose distribution to irregularly shaped targets were better with the Heidelberg conformation technique. The mechanical accuracy of the Tubingen floorstand system was 0.3 mm +/- 0.2 mm, and that of the Heidelberg mask fixation system < 1 mm. Both methods require similar total treatment times. Nine patients were treated by the Tubingen radiosurgery system. The results are compared with 12 patients treated by conformation radiotherapy in Heidelberg. In both patient groups no further tumour growth occurred. Four of 9 single dose treated patients developed side-effects, such as temporary trigeminal and facial paraesthesia hearing deterioration and oedema. In contrast, patients treated by fractionated radiotherapy showed no side-effects. Relating to the short follow-up the results indicate that single dose application has certain drawbacks for special indications. Further studies have to work out which method gives the best treatment results
