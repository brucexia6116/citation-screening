A microchamber, PTW Pinpoint 31006, was used to measure transverse beam profiles for an Elekta Gamma Knife, Model B, and compared with profiles measured with film dosimetry. The microchamber sensitive volume has a diameter of 2 mm, which is smaller than the gamma knife beams, and a length of 5 mm. The chamber was mounted in a custom cassette in a spherical plastic phantom, supplied by Elekta, and oriented in a sagittal plane with the 2-mm dimension at right angles to the transverse plane. The phantom was manually moved across the beam, using the gamma knife x-coordinate trunnions, to measure the profiles. Profiles were also measured with V-film placed in a cassette mounted in the spherical plastic phantom. The films were scanned with a Scanditronix film scanner and converted to dose with a density to dose calibration curve. The results were superimposed for comparison. The beam width at the 50% intensity was measured from the film profiles to give the dimensions of the beams in the orthagonal planes. The ion chamber measurements are compared with the film results for the transverse, x profiles. Good agreement between the film and ion chamber transverse profiles is observed
