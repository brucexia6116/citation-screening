The quality of portal films taken at megavoltage energies is frequently poor, despite the use of various techniques such as lead screens to improve the image. When critical structures, such as the spinal cord, are to be blocked out of the treatment field, it is frequently difficult to determine whether the block is correctly placed. To solve this problem, a diagnostic X ray source has been mounted on the side of a 10 MV linear accelerator to provide accurate verification of patient positioning and location of shielding blocks. The coincidence between the mechanical, 10 MV and diagnostic X ray isocenters is about 1 mm. The system has been designed so that procedures to monitor this coincidence, and adjustment procedures to maintain it, are easily performed
