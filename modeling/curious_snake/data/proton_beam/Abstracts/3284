The authors estimated the influence of proton-beam stereotaxic therapy on a course of epileptic fits in cerebral arteriovenous aneurysms (AVA). A stable disappearance of epileptic fits was noted in 16 of 29 patients (56%), in 12 of them (41%) positive angiography results were noted. The calculated D and V fields of irradiation for 16 patients without fits and for 13 patients with epileptic fits after proton-beam stereotaxic therapy have shown that with D being the same, the effect depends upon a fraction of an AVA irradiated area
