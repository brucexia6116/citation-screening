Intensity-modulated photon radiation therapy (RT; IMRT) and proton therapy are advanced radiation technologies that permit improved conformation of radiation dose to target structures while limiting irradiation of surrounding normal tissues. Application of these technologies in the treatment of rectal and anal cancer is attractive, based on the potential reduction in radiation treatment toxicities that are frequently incurred in the pelvis and perineum. Furthermore, conformal RT might also allow for dose escalation to target areas, leading to improved tumor control. This review discusses the underlying principles of IMRT. In addition, the rationale and clinical data regarding the efficacy of radiation dose escalation for rectal and anal cancer will be highlighted, as well as tolerance of pelvic organs to RT and chemotherapy. Finally, preliminary results of IMRT in the treatment of lower gastrointestinal tract cancers will be reviewed. The potential and rationale for proton therapy in treatment of these malignancies are also discussed. [References: 81]
