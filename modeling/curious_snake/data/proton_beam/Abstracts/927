OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton beam therapy for complicated circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas. METHODS: The study was a retrospective nonrandomized investigation. Seventeen consecutive patients, referred to the Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France, for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma associated with serous retinal detachment were studied. Each eye received a total dose of 20 cobalt gray equivalents (CGEs) delivered in 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs over 4 days. Functional tests included the initial and final best-corrected visual acuity, slitlamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography. Tumor thickness was determined on B-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: The macula was involved in 7 eyes and the lesion was juxtapapillary in 2 eyes. The mean (SD) tumor thickness was 3.06 (9.0) mm. The mean initial tumor diameter was 6.82 mm (range, 3.2-12.1 mm). The right eye was involved in 7 cases and the left eye in 10 cases. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 52 (58) months (range, 36-90 months). Retinal reattachment was obtained in all cases after a mean period of 2 months (range, 1-12 months; median, 1 month). Tumor regression was obtained in all cases. One recurrence occurred 1 year after the initial treatment in an undertreated area. After re-treatment, however, resolution of the retinal detachment occurred, and flattening of the choroidal lesion was obtained. Final visual acuity improved to 2 Snellen lines or more in 16 eyes (94%), was stable in 1 eye, and attained 20/40 or more in 12 eyes (70.6%). No radiation therapy complications occurred during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for choroidal hemangiomas seems to be an effective and safe alternative option. A total dose of 20 CGEs delivered in 4 daily 15-second fractions of 5 CGEs seems adequate for local control of both the tumor and serous retinal detachment
