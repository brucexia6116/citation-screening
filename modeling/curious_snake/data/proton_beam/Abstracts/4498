Prior to routine operation of the neutron therapy unit a radiation survey was performed in order to confirm the shielding design and to assure the safety of the personnel involved in the operation of the unit. The shielding requirements were calculated in accordance with NCRP Report No. 51. The contributions of the neutron and gamma dose equivalents have been measured separately outside the treatment room. The exposure outside the shield is negligible. In general, the measured values were lower than those derived from the shielding calculations. The highest total dose equivalents were registered at locations corresponding to the highest calculated values
