High-energy photon radiotherapy sources produce non-negligible numbers of secondary heavy particles (neutrons, protons and alphas) which contribute to the dose in a patient. They also present a radiation protection problem. The contribution of such particles to the absorbed dose in a tissue-like medium and to the equivalent dose is considered in this study experimentally. Track etch detectors were chosen as a basic type of measuring instrument: cellulose nitrate Kodak LR115 and polyallyldiglycol carbonate CR39 were used as detectors. Several methods of directly read datum (track density, track parameter, LET spectrum etc) interpretation have been analysed. It has been ascertained that the contribution of secondary heavy particles represents approximately 0.002 of the photon dose and 0.02 of the equivalent dose, both at 50 MeV as maximum photon energy. The contribution of a 20 MV bremsstrahlung beam is roughly one-fifth of that at 50 MV
