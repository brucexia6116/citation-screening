This paper describes the status of the design study of the Austrian Ion Therapy and Cancer-Research Centre Project MedAustron. This work was performed during the last two years by the MedAustron study group. The team was spread out over several research institutes and University clinics, with full-time members at the Medical University of Vienna, Innsbruck Medical University and Fotec, Wiener Neustadt in collaboration with the Medical University Graz, the Hospital of Wiener Neustadt, the Vienna University of Technology and the research institutes CERN, PSI, the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava and the Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana. The study group has also worked in cooperation with GSI, Darmstadt and the CNAO foundation, Milan. The agreed aim of this study was to investigate a conceptual design of an accelerator facility which provides optimum treatment conditions for high-precision active beam scanning of cancer tumours with both proton and carbon ions
