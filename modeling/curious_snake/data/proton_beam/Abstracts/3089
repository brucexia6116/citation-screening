Fluence modulation of multiple electron beams of various energies has been used to optimize the delivered dose distribution during electron beam radiation therapy. By maximizing the probability of achieving tumor control without causing severe complications electron beam fluence profiles have been optimized for superficial target volumes. It is possible to use several equiportal fluence-modulated electron beams to modify the energy deposition with depth in a controlled manner making it possible to use the technique as an alternative to bolus. The technique was tested in two representative phantom geometries and in three clinical patient geometries using a set of five and two different energies. The local maxima in dose for the plans with five energies were typically lower than with the conventional or advanced bolus techniques. The principles for how the technique could be carried out in the future with a fourth generation radiotherapy accelerator are also indicated
