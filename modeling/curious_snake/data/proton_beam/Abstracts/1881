Cells with multiple chromosomal aberrations, the so-called rogue cells, were found in blood samples from more than 100 Chernobyl accident clearance workers. A comparative analysis of frequencies of stable and unstable chromosomal aberrations in two worker groups--those with or without rogue cells was made. A higher level of unstable aberrations in persons carrying rogue cells was observed. No difference in the level of stable aberrations between the groups was seen. The possibility of low dose alpha irradiation causing the chromosomal damage is raised
