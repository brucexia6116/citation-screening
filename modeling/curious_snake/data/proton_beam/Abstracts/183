Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is currently one of the most common treatments for obstructive coronary artery disease. The long term success of the treatment, however, is severely limited by restenosis. Recently, different investigators have begun to study the possibility of radiation therapy in restenosis prevention and have shown promising results. However, an optimal radiation delivery device for delivering a highly localized radiation dose to the arterial medial layer while preserving the viability of the artery has yet to be established. In this article, we discuss the development of a unique mixed gamma/beta brachytherapy source capable of delivering high radiation dose to a 0.5 mm thick vessel wall by proton-beam activating an existing nickel titanium stent to produce vanadium-48. The dose distribution of the activated stent is determined by computer simulation using MCNP Monte Carlo code and is verified by radiochromic film measurement
