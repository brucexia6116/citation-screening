The use of heavy particles in the treatment of cancer is increasing remarkably, whether with external radiation or using a vector such as an antibody in radioimmunotherapy. Recent pre-clinical and clinical developments of alpha-radioimmunotherapy have provided more interesting information in parallel of the use of high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) external irradiation. This review aims at presenting recent advances of this therapeutic approach, and at detailing the biological specificities of this kind of radiation. [References: 79]
