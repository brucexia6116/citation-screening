Saturating irradiation far off-resonance can lead to diminution in the water signal seen in MRI, giving rise to magnetization transfer contrast. This results from transfer of magnetization between "solid" protons with restricted motion, which give rise to a band some tens of kilohertz wide, and the narrow signal from mobile protons. In the work reported here a high-power pulse spectrometer, which can detect signals from both mobile and immobile protons, was used to investigate the dynamics of magnetization transfer in cartilage in vitro. Magnetization transfer in modified Hoffman-Forsen inversion transfer experiments was well-described by a single rate constant model; full analytical solutions are offered for the resultant biexponential magnetization recovery curves. The use of pulsed methods to generate magnetization contrast may in some circumstances offer advantages over the steady-state saturation methods used hitherto
