Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers a single high dose of ionizing radiation to a radiographically well-defined, small intracranial target without delivering a significant proportion of the prescribed dose to the surrounding brain tissue. Three methods of delivering the radiosurgical technique include the gamma knife, heavy charged particle beams and external high-energy photon beams from linear accelerators. [References: 9]
