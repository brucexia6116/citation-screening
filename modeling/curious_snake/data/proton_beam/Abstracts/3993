In this methodological paper the authors report a fast, T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence (FLASH) for dynamic, Gd-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of meningiomas and its application in precision radiotherapy planning. Indications for radiotherapy included unresected tumors, tumor remaining after surgery, and recurrences. The patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system which is usable at the CT, MR and the linear accelerator installations. By phantom measurements different materials (steel, aluminum, titanium, plastic, wood, ceramics) used for the stereotactic system were tested for mechanical stability and geometric MR image distortion. All metallic stereotactic rings (closed rings made of massive metal) led to a more or less dramatic geometric distortion and signal cancellation in the MR images. The best properties--nearly no distortion and high mechanic stability--are provided by a ceramic ring. If necessary, the remaining geometric MR image distortion can be 'corrected' (reducing displacements to the size of a pixel) by calculations based on modeling the distortion as a fourth order two-dimensional polynomial. The target volume was defined in dynamic, T1-weighted FLASH MR images, which were measured before, during, and after the controlled intravenous infusion of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight Gd-DTPA. The stereotactic localization technique allows the precise transfer of the target volume information from MR onto CT data to provide a map of the radiation attenuation coefficient for dose calculation. In genera, the superior soft tissue contrast of MR showed an excellent tumor delineation, especially in regions, such as the base of the skull, where the target often was obscured in CT images.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
