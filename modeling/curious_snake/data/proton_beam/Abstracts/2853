A procedure has been developed for producing accurate computer-calculated dose distributions at the air-tissue boundaries for oblique incidence of a photon beam. Measurements of the dose distribution under conditions of tangential incidence are presented for a Siemens 6 MV linear accelerator. These measurements have been compared with calculated distributions using the standard Cunningham-Clarkson calculation technique. Based on this comparison, two changes are suggested for improving the accuracy of the calculation. The grid spacing for the calculation is decreased in order that the rapid dose variations that occur at the boundary may be better followed. Furthermore, the dose calculation scheme is modified to take into account the differences in the amount of electron build-up which occurs. An algorithm is presented for making this modification. Also, the calculated dose at the exit surface had to be modified to handle the deficit of scatter material behind the calculation points. The results of these changes are shown as a comparison of a typical chest wall irradiation treatment plan using two opposing tangential fields
