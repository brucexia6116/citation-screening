BACKGROUND: In elderly patients, patients with multiple morbidities, and patients with a reduced general condition, the standard treatment of inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consists of either chemotherapy or radiation therapy alone and is associated with an extremely poor prognosis. We therefore investigated the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy using vinorelbine plus cisplatin or carboplatin in NSCLC patients at risk for treatment complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients (six women, 27 men, median age 65 years) with locally advanced, functionally inoperable pulmonary carcinomas, recurrent lung cancer or postoperative macroscopic residual tumors (R2) with an increased risk of treatment complications (WHO performance status 2/3; cardiac, renal or pulmonary failure; marked pretherapeutic weight loss; age between 71-75 years) received 12.5 mg of vinorelbine per m(2) body surface area (BSA) on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 plus either cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) BSA (ten patients) or carboplatin 70 mg/m(2) BSA (23 patients) on days 1-5 and 29-33 together with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. The tumor regions were irradiated with doses of up to 63 Gy (90% isodose), and potentially affected lymph nodes received doses of up to 45.0 or 50.4 Gy (90% isodose). RESULTS: Briefly, 31 of 33 patients successfully completed radiation therapy and 26 received four cycles of vinorelbine plus at least two cycles of cisplatin or carboplatin. Hematotoxic side effects included grade III leukocytopenia (n = 8), grade III thrombocytopenia (n = 5), and grade IV thrombocytopenia (n = 2). Other side effects consisted of peripheral neuropathy grade III (n = 1) and esophagitis grade IV (n = 1). Severe pneumonitis did not occur. Six patients had pneumonia before radiochemotherapy. 21 patients (63%) exhibited a complete (n = 7) or partial response (n = 14) to chemoradiation. The twelve nonresponders had either stable (n = 9) or progressive disease (n = 3). The survival rates plus standard deviations were as follows: 1-year survival: 60 +/- 8%, 2-year survival: 36 +/- 9%, 3-year survival: 24 +/- 9%, median survival time: 17 months (5;29 months; 95% confidence interval [CI]), median progression-free survival: 11 months (9;13 months; 95% CI). The median follow-up time was 14 months. CONCLUSION: Conventionally fractionated radiochemotherapy with vinorelbine plus a platinum derivative is feasible in patients with NSCLC and increased risk of treatment complications. Compared to patient populations described in the literature, the survival rates achieved by concurrent radiochemotherapy appear to be better than those achieved with radiotherapy alone
