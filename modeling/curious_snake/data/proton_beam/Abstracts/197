This study was undertaken to develop a method for assaying octapeptide cholecystokinin (CCK-8) using ELISA. The design of the method was based on the pretreatment of polystyrene microplates with ultraviolet irradiation and glutaraldehyde activation piror to coating. The results showed that this pretreatment let to stable attachment of CCK-8 to the solid-phase. Competitive ELISA with CCK-8 as a competitor gave excellent quantitive relationship. Using this method we distinguished two kinds of CCK-related peptides. This method proved to be simple, stable and reproducible, the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 4.75% and 7.80% respectively
