RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. Resected meningiomas were examined by relaxometry and light microscopy to evaluate the potential of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for identifying histologic subtypes and for discriminating among benign, radiation therapy-induced, and malignant meningiomas. METHODS. The magnetic field dependence of 1/T1 of water protons (nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion [NMRD] profile) and the water content (dry weight) were measured for 67 specimens, and the data were compared with histology. Only noncalcified, nonhemorrhagic meningiomas are reported. RESULTS. No correlations were found between NMRD profiles, dry weight, and any histologic subtype, in contrast to an analogous study of astrocytomas. Rather, meningiomas have a broader variability of dry weight and 1/T1 than related parenchyma but a much narrower range than all grades of astrocytomas. The mean value of 1/T1, at all fields, is slightly higher in meningiomas--and the mean water content about the same--as adult cortical gray matter. CONCLUSION. Meningiomas are frequently isointense with cortex, and histologic subtypes cannot be differentiated at any magnetic field strength by MRI using only T1- or proton density-weighted MRI
