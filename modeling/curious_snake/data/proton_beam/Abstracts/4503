Segmented conformal radiation therapy is a new computer-controlled treatment technique under investigation in which the target volume is subdivided into thick transverse segments each of which is then treated individually by rectangular transverse abutting fields. In order to obtain uniform dose at abutments, the machine isocenter remains fixed in the patient and field edges are defined by independently moving focused collimator jaws to give matching geometric divergence. Mechanical variation in jaw and gantry positioning will create some dose variation at field abutments. Film dosimetry was used to study the radiation field positioning accuracy and precision of a commercial linear accelerator. A method of field position calibration was developed using multiple nonabutting fields exposed on the same radiograph. Verification of collimator jaw calibration measurements was performed using multiple abutting fields exposed on a single radiograph. Measurements taken over 5 months of clinical accelerator operation studied the effects of simple jaw motion, simple gantry motion, and combined jaw/gantry motion on jaw position precision and accuracy. The inherent precision and accuracy of radiation field positioning was found to be better than +/- 0.3 mm for both jaws with all types of motions except for the Y2 jaw under combined jaw/gantry motion. When the ability to deliver abutting beams was verified in clinical mode, the average dose variation at abutments was less than 6% at all gantry angles except for one. However, due to accelerator software limitations in clinical mode, the settings for collimator positions could not take advantage of the maximum accuracy of which the hardware is capable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
