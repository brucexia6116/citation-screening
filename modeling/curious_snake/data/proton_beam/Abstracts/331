Among the essential components of a comprehensive quality assurance program in radiotherapy are the quality control protocols to be used on the equipment and, in particular, the performance objectives and criteria. In the present work, we describe the development of a suite of quality control documents for use across Canada. Following a generic format, we are generating concise, clear standards for the most commonly used equipment in radiotherapy, with the emphasis on performance measures. The final standards of performance are confirmed following cross-country consultation facilitated by the availability of draft documents on the Canadian Medical Physics web site
