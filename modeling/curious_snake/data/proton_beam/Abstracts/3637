A device for shaping electron fields from a Therac-20 accelerator is described. The considerable advantage of continuously variable field sizes is enhanced when the shaping device is placed on the lower trimmer bars of the shorter set of electron trimmers, which remain fully adjustable. Cerrobend blocks of 1-cm thickness are sufficient for a 5% attenuation level with 20-MeV electrons and large field sizes
