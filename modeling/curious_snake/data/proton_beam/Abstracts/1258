The medical imaging and therapeutic technologies that are based on the use of radiation are reviewed briefly, with special emphasis on the recent developments of synchrotron radiation (SR) methods. New results have been achieved in all of these areas since the last comprehensive reviews were written in this field. This topical review is intended to make the latest possible results and complete set of references available. The different contrast mechanisms in imaging by x-rays are described. The applications range from whole-body imaging to studies of atomic and molecular structures. The SR imaging applications include coronary angiography, bronchography, mammography, computed tomography, x-ray microscopy and imaging by scattering. The therapy applications include photon activation therapy and microbeam radiation therapy. [References: 120]
