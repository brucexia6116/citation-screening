The results of CT control (n = 154) of 69 patients with cerebral metastases (n = 106) are presented. 89 metastases showed a reduction of volume after radiotherapy. 19 metastases increased in volume, and five patients developed new metastases. In the contrast representation 49 out of 66 patients showed a reduced enhancement after radiotherapy, an increase was observed in twelve patients. In 15 out of 22 cases, the irradiation was followed by a decrease of ventricle compression. In case of ventricular dilatation (n = 5), three decreases and two increases were observed. In case of displacement of the mid line (n = 15), eight decreases, five increases, and two identical results were found. Twelve patients presented radiogenic side effects of the central nervous system or the cerebral metastases
