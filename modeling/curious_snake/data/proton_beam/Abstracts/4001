Lumbar bone marrow was assessed by means of magnetic resonance (MR) in 23 examinations of eight patients who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Various imaging and spectroscopic techniques were applied for measurements carried out prior to conditioning for ABMT/PBSCT and in the course of reconstitution and correlated with clinical and blood chemistry data in these patients. The signal intensity from lumbar bone marrow was determined in T1-weighted and water- and fat-selective MR images. The distribution of the magnetic field was demonstrated by a field-mapping method. Localized proton spectroscopy was performed from volume elements of 2 ml located in the central region of vertebral bodies in order to evaluate the fraction of the water signals, the transverse relaxation times T2 of the signals from water and lipids, and the line widths of the spectral signals. Regions of bone marrow after inflammatory conditions or intensive irradiation are shown to be not involved in marrow reconstitution. Additional information about marrow composition was obtained by the magnetic field mapping and by the line widths in the spectra. Considerable alterations of the amount of paramagnetic hemosiderin were revealed following transplantation. Patients with low water signal and strong local inhomogeneities of the magnetic field in the marrow prior to transplantation had a delayed hematopoietic reconstitution compared with the patients lacking these MR features
