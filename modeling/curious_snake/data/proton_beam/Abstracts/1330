PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to solve anisotropy in the dose distributions from rotational conformal radiotherapy (RCRT) by using a C-arm-mounted accelerator. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The linac head was designed to move along the C-arm with a maximum angle of 60 degrees (from a vertical position toward the gantry). Simultaneous rotation of the gantry creates a dynamic conical irradiation technique. Dynamic conical conformal radiation therapy (Dyconic CRT) was developed by combining the technique with continuous motion of a multileaf collimator. Dose distributions were measured in phantoms using film densitometry and compared with conventional RCRT. Dose distributions in actual radiation therapy patients are also presented. RESULTS: Dyconic CRT enabled the precise delivery of noncoplanar beams without rotating the table. The measurements showed that three-dimensionally isotropic dose falloff was achieved with Dyconic CRT. Dose inhomogeneity in the sagittal direction with Dyconic CRT was compensated for by use of wedge filters. CONCLUSIONS: The drawbacks of the dose distributions produced by RCRT were overcome with the use of Dyconic CRT
