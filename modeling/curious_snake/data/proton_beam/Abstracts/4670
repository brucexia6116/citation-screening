Clinically proved "alternative breast-preserving method" applicable for patients with locally advanced nodal breast cancer. These patients refuse to go in to surgery or have indications for surgery (183 patients--T(1-4)N(0-3)M(0-1)). This method consists of the combination of the traditional method of the whole breast and/or nodal photon irradiation with local highly concentrated proton irradiation in the dosage iso-equivalent to tumor (proton with energy from 130 to 180 MeV, with stop in the target in notice depth). We used the irradiation of the adenohypophysis with narrow proton beams energy 200 MeV. The aim of the first combination of the components is the selectively influence on the target and the channeling to the tumor and its subclinical substances the dosages sufficient for the total irradiation of tumor with sparing surrounding tissues and parts of body. The goal of irradiation of adenohypophysis with protons is the normalization of its hormonal activity and elimination of factors stimulating growth of tumor cells in case of dishormonal cancer. The suggested method didu't only improve the results of the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, but also contributed to the reducing of the emotional stress. We received high results of the patients with locally advanced nodal breast cancer of criteria: local control rate (96%), long remission (more then 40%) and 5-year actuarial survival rate (83%). The patients examined during 5 and 18 years. It made a good cosmetic effect and high quality life of the patients with breast cancer
