The development of sophisticated conformal radiation techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, image-guided radiation therapy, adaptative radiation therapy, and radiosurgery, implies precise and accurate targeting. To achieve this goal, a lot of new devices and techniques have been designed and are now available in radiation therapy departments : modern 3D-imaging systems, sophisticated treatment planning systems, breathing-adapted radiotherapy equipments (for gating and tracking techniques), in-room 3D-imaging systems, tomotherapy, etc. Purpose of this review is to briefly present the new equipments which are now used in radiation therapy departments in conformal therapy.
