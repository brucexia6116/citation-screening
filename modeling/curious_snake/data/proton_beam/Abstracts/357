BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is an integral component in the management of childhood malignancies and undergoes a continuous process of optimization within the prospective trials of the GPOH. At present there are approximately 20 active protocols, some specifying radio-oncological study questions, in which about 500 to 600 children annually are given radiotherapy. MATERIALS/METHODS: The Pediatric Radiation Oncology Working Group (APRO) of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) represents the organizational link between GPOH and DEGRO. Their activities range from phrasing guidelines of radio-oncological therapy, through writing a protocol for a prospective study on radiation-induced late effects (RISK--in co-operation with GPOH, 695 patients registered so far) and organizing meetings for information transfer, to implementing radio-oncology within the prospective studies of the GPOH by establishing study chairs for radio-oncology when radio-oncological questions are a primary focus and/or to function as a reference institution for quality assurance. These activities also include individual case consultations outside the study proper. Twice annually the members of the APRO meet for an update on current knowledge and future directions where a representative of the GPOH is invited to contribute special aspects of pediatric oncology. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, modern technology (intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy, inclusion of imaging in treatment planning) will be part of disease management in pediatric oncology. A working group for modern radiotherapy technology was established to enhance this development. Prospective studies of the GPOH with primary or secondary radio-oncological questions require the implementation of corresponding tasks (documentation, monitoring, etc.) in order to meet future demands on clinical trials and to achieve the aims of the protocol. Consequently adequate financial support is indispensable
