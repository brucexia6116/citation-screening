Eighty-nine patients with carcinoma of the cervix received radical radiation therapy from May 1981 through 1983 at the hospital of the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. After a 2 to 4 year follow-up, primary cancer was found to be controlled in 59 patients, a recurrence was noted in 16 patients but 12 patients had died without precise information concerning recurrence. We examined the correlation between recurrence and seven prognostic factors. Among these factors, the tumor volume, age, and the red blood corpuscle sedimentation rate showed a relatively strong correlation. A multivariable analysis (quantification methods II) was undertaken in order to integrate these prognostic factors and the score that was calculated from this analysis showed a strong correlation to local control. We believe that this score can be used for predicting recurrences and can be applied to the selection of patients for new treatments like hyperthermia or high LET irradiation
