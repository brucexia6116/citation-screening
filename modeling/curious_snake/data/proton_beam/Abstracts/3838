It exists the possibility in the neutron therapy of specific tumours to increase the local energy dose in the tumour by treatment with fast neutrons under use of B-10. Thermal neutrons cause the neutron capture reaction B-10(n, alpha)Li-7 in tissue. A sufficiently high number of thermic neutrons is necessary combined with a possibly selective concentration of B-10 in the tumour as target volume for the clinical application. Gold foils were activated in a water phantom at several depths for the quantitative determination of the thermal neutron fluence. A result of this measurements is a maximal thermal neutron fluence of 1.44 X 10(10) cm-2 at depth of 5 cm with applied total energy dose of 0.8 Gy
