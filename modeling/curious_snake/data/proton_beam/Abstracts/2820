The relative 5-year survival was 32 per cent in 97 patients with T2 or T3 bladder carcinoma (1972-1978) treated with high dose radiation therapy (CRE greater than or equal to 1700 reu). A slight but significant difference was noted between the two T categories. Fifty-three patients who were tumour-free 3 to 4 months after irradiation had a 55 per cent survival. No other prognostic parameters were identified on the basis of histologic or radiologic findings. In 14 patients severe radiation complications were observed (bladder 9, small bowel 3, combined 2). In patients with radiation sensitive bladder carcinoma, radical radiation therapy seems to be a comparable alternative to total cystectomy
