The described whole-body irradiations are effected in order to prepare patients with acute myeloic leukemia for bone marrow transplantation. The patient is irradiated with equal doses from the right and the left side. So a dose of 10 Gy in the middle of the body is achieved which is determined individually by means of phantom measurements. In order to avoid the risk of an interstitial pneumonitis, the lung region is temporarily blinded in such a way that a dose of 8 Gy is obtained there in the middle of the body. During the irradiations, the accumulated dose is measured in different body regions with thermoluminescence dosimeters, a semi-conductor diode and, eventually, a ionization chamber. The scattering width is +/- 13%. We do our best to make the patient's position as comfortable as possible
