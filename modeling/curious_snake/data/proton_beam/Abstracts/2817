Electron beam therapy is the superior modality of treatment for advanced skin cancer or in specific anatomical situations. The authors report the results for the electron beam therapy of 31 patients with advanced skin carcinoma. There were 15 squamous cell carcinomas, 11 basal cell carcinomas and 5 mixed, basosquamous cell carcinomas. All lesions were 3 cm or greater in maximum diameter. With follow-up ranging from 1 to 6 years, 28 patients have not evidence of disease, 1 is dead with disease, 1 is alive with suspicious residual disease and 1 is alive with recurrence. Acute and late complications are acceptable; bone, cartilage and soft tissue necrosis are not reported. The treatment results are similar to those in the literature and show the advantages of the electron beam irradiation for advanced skin carcinomas
