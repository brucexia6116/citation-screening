A review of the literature was carried out to investigate the following: the fraction of Pu in the body that was in the gonads; the necessity for a localization factor in calculating the genetic dose to humans; and the possibility that an unexpectedly high relative biological effectiveness (RBE) causing genetic effects could occur for alpha particles. Human autopsy data from both occupationally exposed persons and the public were relied on to determine the amount of Pu in the gonads. It was found that an average fraction of 3 X 10(-3) of the Pu in the body was in the ovaries and testes but there was a wide variation among individuals. While a localization factor over the average of 2.5-4 is needed to calculate the dose to the sensitive cells for rodents, no such factor is required for the human. Information on the RBE for various genetic effects shows RBEs for Pu alpha's about as would be expected from neutron irradiation. The usual quality factor applied in calculating dose equivalent is appropriate and may be conservative, particularly for females. [References: 32]
