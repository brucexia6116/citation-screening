Proton therapy was developed as one of the most promising radiation therapy techniques and it has shown remarkable improvement of the local cure rate of cancer lesions and decrease of late injury. However, cooperation with chemotherapy is to be considered as a reasonable way to further improve the radical cure rate, because the indication of proton therapy is limited to a single primary lesion. Thereupon, combined chemotherapy before or after completion of the proton therapy of the primary lesion to control latent metastases of lung cancer, esophageal cancer, to control multicentric lesions of liver cancer, urinary bladder cancer, or to diminish the size of the lesions with too much volume, could well contribute to improved clinical results
