Arterio-venous malformation (AVM) is a rare phenomenon in children. However, when this event does occur, the outcome can be devastating. This paper outlines the underlying pathogenesis of AVM and the early clinical features associated with an AVM bleed. Clinical manifestations include hemorrhage, seizures, headaches, bruit and congestive heart failure in neonates. Common diagnostic studies include cranial ultrasound, cerebral angiography, CT scan, MRI, brain scan, EEG, skull films, lumber puncture and blood flow studies. Treatment for AVM bleeds includes conservative management, surgical intervention, flow-directed embolization and laser beam/proton beam radiation. The components of a nursing neurological assessment are illustrated best in a case study. Steps in the press include: pre-bleed/pre-operature control, fluid and electrolytes, nutrition, musculoskeletal and emotional support
