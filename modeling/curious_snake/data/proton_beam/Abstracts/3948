alpha-Emitting radionuclides may be an effective alternative treatment against ovarian carcinoma because they have short half-lives and are densely ionizing, with high linear energy transfer to a depth of several cell diameters without requiring cellular oxygenation. One radionuclide that has been generated and tested in our laboratory in vitro and in vivo is lead 212 (212Pb). Intraperitoneal instillation of 212Pb prolonged survival and totally eradicated tumor in 24% of mice inoculated with the extremely virulent Ehrlich ascites-producing tumor. In vitro 212Pb was two to four times more effective in killing human ovarian cancer cells than x-rays. Irradiation with 212Pb increased the radiosensitivity and chromosomal aberrations of cells. In dogs, intraperitoneal instillation of 2.6 mCi of ferrous hydroxide tagged with 212Pb caused no significant toxicity. It appears that alpha-emitting radionucides such as 212Pb have the potential to be a new and potent treatment of ovarian carcinoma and could be effective in cases that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy or x-ray therapy
