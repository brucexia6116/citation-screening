The technique of forming electron beams by one scattering foil and one compensating foil is discussed. This method provides a means for producing large-size uniform dose distributions with much smaller losses in dose rate as compared with conventional beam forming by one foil. Moreover, the energy losses involved in this process and the backgroung of concomitant bremsstrahlung are much less. A technique of calculation to determine approximate parameters of the compensating foils is described
