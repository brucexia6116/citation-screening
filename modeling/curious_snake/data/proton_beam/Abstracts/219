Since radiation fields of space contain many-fold more protons than high atomic number, high energy (HZE) particles, cells in astronaut crews will experience on average several proton hits before an HZE hit. Thus radiation regimes of proton exposure before HZE particle exposure simulate space radiation exposure, and measurement of the frequency of neoplastic transformation of human primary cells to anchorage-independent growth simulates an initial step in cancer induction. Although previous investigations indicated a synergistic increase in transformation yields in the cells exposed to protons followed by HZE particles, these experiments did not differentiate between the effect of splitting of the dose into two fractions and that of changing the ion beams. To test this, we irradiated cells with split doses of either protons or HZE particles, then measured clonogenic survival and neoplastic transformation, as measured by colony formation in semi-solid soft agar medium. The data show that the split dose of 20 cGy plus 20 cGy of either H or HZE ions gave about the same effect as the 40 cGy uninterrupted dose, quite different from the effect of the mixed ion beam H + HZE irradiation. We also asked if lower proton doses than 20 cGy followed 15 min later by 20 cGy of HZE ions gave greater than additive transformation frequencies. Substantial increases in transformation levels were observed for all proton doses tested, including 1 cGy. These results point to the signal importance of protons in affecting the effect of space radiation on human cells
