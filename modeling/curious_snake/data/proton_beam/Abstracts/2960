Spallation is induced in a heavy material by 72-MeV protons. The resulting neutrons can be characterized by an evaporation spectrum with a peak energy of less than 2 MeV. The neutrons are moderated in two steps: first in iron and then in carbon. Results from neutron fluence measurements in a perspex phantom placed close to the moderator are presented. Monte Carlo calculations of neutron fluence in a water phantom are also presented under some chosen configurations of spallation source and moderator. The calculations and measurements are in good agreement and show that, for proton currents of less than 0.5 mA, useful thermal-neutron fluences are attainable in the depth of the brain. However, the dose contribution from the unavoidable gamma background component has not been included in the present investigation
