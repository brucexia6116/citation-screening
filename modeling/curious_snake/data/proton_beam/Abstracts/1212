Starting with the pioneering work at the University of California in Berkeley in 1977, heavy ion radiotherapy has been of increasing interest especially in Japan and Europe in the last decade. There are currently 3 facilities treating patients with carbon ions, two of them in Japan within a clinical setting. In Germany, a research therapy facility is in operation and the construction of a new hospital based facility at the Heidelberg university will be started soon. An outline of the current status of heavy ion radiotherapy is given with emphasis to the technical aspects of the respective facilities. This includes a description of passive and active beam shaping systems, as well as their implications for treatment planning and dosimetry. The clinical trials and routine treatments performed at the German heavy ion facility are summarized. An overview over the upcoming new facilities and their technical possibilities is given. It is discussed what the necessary improvements are to fully exploit the potential of these facilities. Especially the new Heidelberg facility with the possibility of active beam scanning in combination with the first isocentric gantry for ions and offering beams of protons, helium, oxygen and carbon ions has implications on treatment planning, dosimetry and quality assurance. The necessary and ongoing developments in these areas are summarized. The new facilities also offer the possibilities to perform more extensive clinical studies and to explore future indications for radiotherapy with heavy ions. An overview over the indications and treatment schemes is also given. [References: 48]
