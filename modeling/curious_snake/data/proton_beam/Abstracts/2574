Changes in dose distributions in buildup region resulting from the presence of lead, aluminum, and lucite absorbers above the surface of a polystyrene phantom were evaluated. The surface dose, as a function of the absorber thickness, is presented as well as the influence of the air gap between the lead absorber and the phantom surface. It has been found that the surface dose does not depend on absorber thickness for absorbers thicker than the range of secondary electrons in the absorber material (after corrections for the attenuation of the primary beam in the absorber). Similarly, the depth dose curves in the phantom were elevated only at depths lower than the range of secondary electrons in the phantom. The applicability of the presented data in clinical radiotherapy is discussed
