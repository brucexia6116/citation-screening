Twenty-seven eyes harboring a choroidal melanoma which could not be treated by other methods were treated with external beam radiation using a linear accelerator. After a mean follow-up period of 15.6 months 3 eyes had to be enucleated. In two eyes fresh tumors developed, which were successfully treated with local beta-radiation. In the remaining 22 eyes the tumor growth was stopped or the tumor regressed. External beam therapy for choroidal melanomas seems to be an effective alternative to enucleation in eyes with tumors not accessible for other methods of treatment and which cannot be enucleated, e.g., single eyes
