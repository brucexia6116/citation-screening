Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in developing countries. Irradiating the exudative form, in which a choroidal neovascular membrane develops in the subfoveal area, is presently a treatment under investigation. In 1995, Massachusetts General Hospital, collaborating with Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, initiated a protocol to treat SCNV membranes using the proton beam at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory and the EYEPLAN program with a light-field setup. EYEPLAN requires the axial eye length, membrane dimensions, and manipulation of the eye to include a 4.0-mm radial margin around the membrane so that the aperture margin (50% isodose line on the posterior retina) abuts the inferior aspect of the limbus. Review of 100 individually prepared plans showed that 95% of the fabricated apertures were circular (aspect ratio < 1.095) with diameters 9.5 to 15.0 mm. This information was used to develop an automated standard plan. Thirty-nine plans were developed for axial lengths ranging from 21.0 to 25.0 mm and membrane sizes from 1.5 to 6.75 mm in the usual way as the reviewed ones. Circular targets were outlined centered on the fovea. Distal and proximal 90% ranges (modulation) to the target, and doses to macula, optic disc, lens, ciliary body, retina, and globe were calculated. An automated standard plan requiring the same input data, but avoiding the need for individual plans, was developed. The program outputs the aperture diameter, fixation angle for the light-field setup, range and modulation, and calculates dose to the macula and optic nerve and percentage of retina receiving > or = 50% and > or = 90% of the prescribed dose. Individual plans require approximately 1.5 hours; the standard plan, 5 minutes. The standard plan could have treated 86% of the reviewed plans. The automated plan provides accurate and efficient treatment parameters for the majority of patients
