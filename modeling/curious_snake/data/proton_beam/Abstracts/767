A simple and rapid procedure was developed for the purification of cyclotron-produced 203Pb via the 203Tl(d,2n) 203Pb reaction. A Pb(II) selective ion-exchange resin, with commercial name Pb Resin from Eichrom Technologies, Inc., was used to purify 203Pb from the cyclotron-irradiated Tl target with excellent recovery of the enriched Tl target material. The purified 203Pb was used to radiolabel the monoclonal antibody Herceptin. The in vitro and in vivo properties of the 203Pb radioimmunoconjugate were evaluated
