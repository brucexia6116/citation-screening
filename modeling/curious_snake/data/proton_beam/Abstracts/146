The use of non-coplanar conformal therapy necessitates the use of unusual beam projections that may not be accomplished with a conventional linear accelerator table top. Modification of the table top can increase the available combinations of gantry and couch rotation. A standard Philips table top, supplied with an SL 75-5 linear accelerator, was modified to increase available combinations of gantry and couch rotation. This was accomplished by shortening the length and decreasing the width of the table top. The modified table top increases the combinations of gantry and couch angles significantly, simplifying the delivery of non-coplanar conformal therapy without significant compromise to routine treatment. The modification of a standard linear accelerator table top has increased the available combinations of gantry and couch rotation to accommodate non-coplanar conforrmal radiotherapy
