Between 1960 and 1980 111 patients with malignomas of the vulva were treated. Among these 86 cases were admitted primarily with view of treatment. Within the period conception of therapy was changed drastically. Where as in former time treatment consists in excision of the tumour with following conventional X-ray therapy, since 1973 therapy of choice was radical vulvectomy with inguinal lymphonodectomy. Based on these facts a retrospective comparison of the survival rates in possible, particularly distribution of stages is likely the same in the two groups. The group treated since 1973 has essential better survival rates. This can be attributed to the conception of radical operative treatment preferred in literature predominantly. Mortality rate is below 5 per cent which will be favourable in the geriatric clientele. To make the results of treatment comparable internationally a postoperative classification should be proposed like in breast cancer. The question of the position of an additional postoperative irradiation is to be answered only with aid of a prospective multicenter study
