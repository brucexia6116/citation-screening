Narrowband irradiation of water protons with a surface coil yields significant nuclear Overhauser enhancement (nOe) of phosphocreatine (PCr) and some adenosine triphosphate (ATP) moieties in localized and unlocalized phosphorus (31P) NMR spectra from chest and heart muscle. In seven normal subjects at 1.5 T the nOe values were 0.6 +/- 0.3, 0.6 +/- 0.3, 0 +/- 0.3, and 0.3 +/- 0.2 for myocardial PCr, gamma-ATP, alpha-ATP, and beta-ATP, respectively, not significantly different from those in chest muscle. Distortion of the measured PCr/ATP ratios due to differences in the nOe may require accurate correction to realize the full benefit of the effect in studies involving quantitative intergroup comparisons
