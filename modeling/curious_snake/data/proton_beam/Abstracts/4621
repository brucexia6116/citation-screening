Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor. Radiation therapy has now replaced enucleation as the treatment of choice, with radioactive eye plaques and proton therapy being the two most studied radiotherapy modalities. More recently, stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy have emerged as promising, non-invasive treatments for uveal melanoma. This review summarizes the available literature on these newer treatment modalities. [References: 39]
