Between 1980 and 1986 ten patients (two males, eight females, median age: 35 years) with spongioblastomas and ependymomas grade I of the spinal cord were treated with fast neutrons from the d(14) + Be reaction after incomplete tumour surgery. Eight patients received three weekly fractions of 0.7 to 1.33 Gy and two patients four weekly fractions of 0.8 Gy to total doses of 7.4 to 10.4 Gy. Two complete and six partial remissions of ataxia and motor disturbances were observed. Bladder dysfunctions in five patients cleared up partially in three cases. In two patients the symptomatology remained unchanged. After a follow-up of eight to 88 months two initially complete and two out of six partial remission were maintained. No severe late effects of the skin have been determined. In summary it is concluded that for incompletely resected "pencil"-gliomas fast neutron therapy seems to be a feasible treatment modality
