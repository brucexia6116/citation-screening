Five patients with choroidal malignant melanomas were treated with proton irradiation with a cyclotron. We developed an accurate method of aiming the proton beam within the eye. Four to five tantalum rings, 2 mm in diameter, were sutured to the sclera at the edges of the tumor, which is localized by indirect ophthalmoscopy and transillumination. The rings were used as markers for stereotactic radiography to align precisely the tumors with the proton beam. The patients were given a total tumor dose of 4,730 to 6,670 rads, delivered in five equal fractions, over a period of eight to nine days. All patients tolerated the treatments well without any adverse effects. The tumor response to therapy could not be evaluated at the completion of treatment since there was no immediate observable reaction of the tumor or of the surrounding retina. Although there has been no definite regression in any patient, we observed a change in the "color" of the tumor in the first two patients and resolution of two serous retinal detachments
