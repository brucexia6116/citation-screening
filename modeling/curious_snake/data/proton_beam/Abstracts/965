Target motion is one of the major limitations of each high precision radiation therapy. Using advanced active beam delivery techniques, such as the magnetic raster scanning system for particle irradiation, the interplay between time-dependent beam and target position heavily distorts the applied dose distribution. This paper presents a simulation environment in which the time-dependent effect of target motion on heavy-ion irradiation can be calculated with dynamically scanned ion beams. In an extension of the existing treatment planning software for ion irradiation of static targets (TRiP) at GSI, the expected dose distribution is calculated as the sum of several sub-distributions for single target motion states. To investigate active compensation for target motion by adapting the position of the therapeutic beam during irradiation, the planned beam positions can be altered during the calculation. Applying realistic parameters to the planned motion-compensation methods at GSI, the effect of target motion on the expected dose uniformity can be simulated for different target configurations and motion conditions. For the dynamic dose calculation, experimentally measured profiles of the beam extraction in time were used. Initial simulations show the feasibility and consistency of an active motion compensation with the magnetic scanning system and reveal some strategies to improve the dose homogeneity inside the moving target. The simulation environment presented here provides an effective means for evaluating the dose distribution for a moving target volume with and without motion compensation. It contributes a substantial basis for the experimental research on the irradiation of moving target volumes with scanned ion beams at GSI which will be presented in upcoming papers
