A strategy for improved treatment of malignant gliomas grade III-IV is presented. The strategy can briefly be described as surgical removal of the bulky tumor, high precision external irradiation of small brain volumes over and near the primary tumor area with high doses from proton beams, and thereafter treatment of spread cells with toxic radionuclides. Proton beams suitable for this are under development. The clinical effects of high single doses on malignant gliomas grade III-IV are presently tested with conventional gamma radiation. Targeting of spread glioma cells with toxic radionuclides tagged to epidermal growth factor, EGF, or to EGF-dextran is presently tested in experimental systems and can, in the near future, be tested in combination with local high doses of external proton radiation. The possibilities to combine proton beams with EGF-guided neutron capture therapy will be considered in a longer perspective
