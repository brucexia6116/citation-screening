A technique to apply reconstructed X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for target determination in stereotactic Bragg peak proton beam therapy of intracranial lesions was developed. Twenty-one benign intracranial tumors and vascular abnormalities were managed using this technique. Clinical features of these lesions, as well as targeting problems associated with the MRI and CT image interpretation, are presented
