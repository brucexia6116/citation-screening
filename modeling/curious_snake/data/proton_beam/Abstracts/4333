Between 1984 and 1991 86 patients with single cerebral metastases underwent linear accelerator radiosurgery using the atraumatic and reproducible Greitz-Bergstrom head-fixation device. Routine one-month follow-up documented disappearance of the tumour in 16 patients, with resolution of the oedema and ventricular shift. Shrinkage of the metastasis occurred in 51 patients. In 9 patients the tumour remained stable, in 7 there was progression of tumour size. Among the patients showing shrinkage of the tumour or unchanged tumour volume, repeated radiosurgery resulted in disappearance of the metastasis in 5 and further shrinkage in 28. In 14 patients routine stereotactic CT follow-up study led to the detection of a new metastasis, again treated with excellent results. Local recurrence occurred in 2 patients and radiation necrosis in the target area in 5 patients. Radiosurgery thus proves to be an appropriate alternative to surgery. The versatility of our non-invasive and painless method permits CT staging (which we consider essential) without hospitalization of the patient
