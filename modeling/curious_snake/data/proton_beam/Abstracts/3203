In order to fully utilize the excellent dose distribution of heavy charged particles for radiation therapy a 3-D spot beam scanning method for proton conformation therapy has been developed. It is effective in reducing the dose to normal tissues compared with the ordinary beam scattering method or the 2-D spot beam scanning method. Hopefully, it will also be useful for heavy charged particle therapy in the future
