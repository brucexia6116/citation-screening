Asymmetric fields defined by independent jaws can be used to split a beam or to match adjacent fields. We have extended a method originally developed for symmetric fields to calculate the dose for asymmetric fields. The dose to a point is computed as the product of the tissue maximum ratio (TMR), the off center ratio (OCR), and the inverse square factor. The TMR is computed from the measured central axis depth doses for symmetric fields. The OCR is obtained by multiplying the primary OCR (POCR) and the boundary factors (BF's) for the four jaws. The POCR's and BF's were derived from measured beam profiles, which include the effect of off-axis beam quality variations. Using this method, the beam profiles and isodose distributions for asymmetric fields of a 6-MV accelerator were calculated and compared with the measured data. The agreement is within experimental errors both in the penumbra region and along the central ray of the asymmetric field
