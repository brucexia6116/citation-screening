Oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL), a potent atherogenic lipoprotein, has been shown to cause the alteration of various endothelial functions. We have examined the effect of oxidized LDL on the cofactor activity for thrombin-dependent protein C activation and expression of thrombomodulin (TM), a cell surface antithrombotic glycoprotein, on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Oxidized LDL prepared by irradiation of LDL with 254-nm ultraviolet light did not directly affect the cofactor activity of isolated TM. Exposure of the cells to oxidized LDL (25-200 microg/ml), but not native LDL and acetylated LDL, reduced TM cofactor activity in parallel with its antigen levels on the cell surface in an oxidation-, concentration- and time-dependent manner. TM mRNA levels were reduced prior to decrease in TM antigen levels and were 50% of the control levels at 3.0 h after treatment of the cells with oxidized LDL. The apparent half-life time (t1/2 = 2.8 h) of TM mRNA in the oxidized LDL-treated cells, however, did not significantly differ from that (t1/2 = 2.6 h) in the control cells when the cells were coincubated with 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, a transcriptional inhibitor. Treatment of the cells with bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor for the proton pump of the lysosomes, inhibited intracellular degradation of the LDL and prevented down-regulations of the mRNA and the cell surface TM antigen levels caused by oxidized LDL. The inhibitor molecule in oxidized LDL was shown to be a lipid; organic solvent extracts (300 mg/ml cholesterol, an equivalent concentration with lipids in 200 microg/ml oxidized LDL) of oxidized LDL inhibited expression of TM antigen to nearly the same extent as the oxidized LDL, although water extracts did not affect TM expression on the cells. These results suggested that down-regulation of TM on endothelial cells exposed to oxidized LDL resulted from inhibition of its transcription mediated by lysosomal degradation of oxidized LDL and that a lipid component in the LDL could be an active species. A decrease in TM expression on the surface of endothelial cells may contribute to promote thrombosis in atherosclerotic lesions
