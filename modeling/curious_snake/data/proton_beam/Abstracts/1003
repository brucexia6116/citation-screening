The cellular microdosimetry parameters including the cellular S-value and the single-event specific energy distribution for alpha particles and electrons are important in radiation dosimetry and biology. These parameters may be used to determine the relative biological effectiveness of radiations in the boron neutron capture therapy. In the present work, such parameters were calculated for different source to target region combinations, i.e. cell surface, cytoplasm, nucleus and cell. Calculations were made using a semi-analytical model that simulated the emission of alpha particles or electrons by the Monte Carlo method and calculated the energy imparted to the target volume by the analytical method. Delta particle equilibrium and partial delta particle equilibrium were applied to alpha particles and electrons, respectively. Range-energy relations were employed to determine the incident and emerging energies of the primary particles. For electrons, the fraction in the energy loss resulting from the generation of bremsstrahlung and high-energy secondary electrons was estimated. The energy loss straggling of electrons entering and leaving a target volume was also estimated. Calculated cellular S-values were compared to corresponding data of the MIRD Committee. Calculated single-event specific energy distributions were also compared to results calculated using the Penelope code
