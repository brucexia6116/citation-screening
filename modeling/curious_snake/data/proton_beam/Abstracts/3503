In order to treat patients with mycosis fungoides, the authors were led to breakdown the energy of a 7 MeV electron bundle emitted by a linear accelerator. With this aim, they sought to determine the nature, thickness and position of the decelerating which should be used to obtain adequate flow and energy of the electron bundle. They then explain the technique of total body irradiation of the patients, and in particular the way in which the functions of the bundle are effected. Finally, in order to diminish under-dosage in regions of the human body irradiated tangentially, they suggest the use of a perspex screen of variable thickness
