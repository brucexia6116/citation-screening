The spatial correlation between individual particle traversals and the nuclear CDKN1A (p21) response after high-LET irradiation of human fibroblasts was investigated. The experiments were based on a technique for the retrospective detection of particle traversals by means of nuclear track detectors, which were used as the cell substratum. This technique requires the precise repositioning of a sample at different steps of the experimental procedure and uses a computerized microscope stage control. The precision of the spatial correlation is further enhanced by means of reference marks in the track etch material that are produced by preirradiation of the plates with charged-particle beams at low fluences. The pattern of the CDKN1A foci that were induced by charged-particle traversals at 1 h postirradiation was found to coincide extremely well with the pattern of particle tracks. This represents direct evidence that CDKN1A foci are located at the sites of particle traversals and thus provides further evidence that the radiation-induced accumulation of the CDKN1A protein takes place at the sites of the primary damage
