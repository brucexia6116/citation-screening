The increased interest in high precision radiation therapy is to a large extent driven by the potential of modern imaging technology. The aim of this project was to analyse how an expensive proton facility best could support a multi-centre health care system. We have developed a model for distributed expert collaboration where all clinical experts will work close to their patients in regional centres. Patients who are candidates for proton therapy will be examined and dose-planned at their regional clinic, discussed in a fully information supported video conference and digitally made available at the proton treatment facility. The proton facility itself will be placed near a communication centre easily reached by all patients where they will be treated under full responsibility of their own physician at the home clinic. This concept has been analysed in detail both with respect to the overall functionality and with respect to possible weaknesses. It was found that the concept of distributed radiation therapy, as proposed here, will offer a stable clinical solution for advanced radiation therapy. It will support the spread of knowledge, serve as a fully developed backup system and the concept will further serve as an efficient base for clinical research
