The design and construction of a new fast neutron facility and first dosimetric results obtained from seven neutron beams are presented. The neutrons are produced by bombarding beryllium targets with protons and deuterons from our K = 32 negative ion cyclotron. The dose rate in air 1 m distance from the thick target within a 13 x 13 cm2 field amounts to about 50 cGy/min at 30 microA of 32 MeV protons
