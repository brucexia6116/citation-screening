Neutrons have radiobiological characteristics, which differ from those of conventional radiotherapy beams (photons) and which offer a theoretical advantage over photons to fight radioresistance by the differential relative biological effect of them between normal and tumour tissues. Neutron therapy beneficed of great interest between 1975 and 1985. Many of phase III trials were conducted and indications have been definitively deducted of them. After briefly describing the properties of neutron beams, this review discusses the indication of neutron therapy on the basis of the clinical results. Salivary, prostate tumours and sarcomas are the main indications of neutron therapy. In concern to the prostate cancers, other alternative treatments reduce the neutron therapy field. For sarcomas, the lack of randomised trials limits the impact of the interest of neutrons. For other tumours, the ratio benefice/risk of neutron therapy is inferior to these obtained with photons and they could not be considered like classical indications. [References: 85]
