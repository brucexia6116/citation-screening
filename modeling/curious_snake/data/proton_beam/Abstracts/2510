At the university of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, patients have been irradiated for 10 years with heavy ions (He, C, Ne, Si). Due to the biologic efficacy of this type of radiation as well as the possibility of a precise dose application, the tumors can be irradiated with very high doses without exposing the surrounding tissues. The experience gained in the treatment of more than 800 patients is presented. It shows that this radiation can be used to localize tumors situated near to particularly radiosensitive organs such as skull base, paraspinal region, and the eye. [References: 26]
