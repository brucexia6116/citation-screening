We report successful use of bleomycin in a low-grade astrocytoma tumor cyst of the tectal plate. A 6-year-old male underwent subtotal resection of a low-grade astrocytoma of the tectal plate followed by chemotherapy and proton beam radiation at age 2 and a half. Despite resolution of the solid portion of the tumor, serial MRI showed enlargement of a bilobar tumor cyst 3 years after the original diagnosis. The patient developed progressive ataxia, short-term memory loss and dysconjugate gaze. Following stereotactic placement of an Ommaya reservoir into the cyst, Isovue contrast and CT scan were used to confirm the integrity of the cyst. Five consecutive daily doses of 3.0 mg of bleomycin were instilled into the cyst after removal of cyst fluid. The therapy was well tolerated in the outpatient setting, and the clinical findings resolved. Subsequent CT and MRI at 4 months and 2 years after bleomycin confirmed no recurrence of the tumor or cyst. Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel
