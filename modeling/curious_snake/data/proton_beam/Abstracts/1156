Exact reproducibility of patient positioning is a critical issue for proton therapy because of the sharp dose distribution. We constructed the first proton therapy system with a common couch for both CT and proton irradiation. In this paper, we report a brief overview of the instruments and the accuracy of mechanical positioning reproducibility
