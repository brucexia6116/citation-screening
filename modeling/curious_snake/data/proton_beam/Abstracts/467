This note investigated the dosimetric uncertainties due to the positional error when centring a small cutout to the machine central beam axis (CAX) in electron radiotherapy. A group of six circular cutouts with 4 cm diameter were made with their centres shifting 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mm from the machine CAX for the 6 x 6 cm(2) applicator. The per cent depth doses, beam profiles and output factors were measured using the 4, 9 and 16 MeV clinical electron beams produced by a Varian 21 EX linear accelerator. The 2D isodose distributions in the z-x (or cross-line) and z-y (or in-line) plane were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation using the EGSnrc system. When the cutout centre was shifted away from the machine CAX for the 4 MeV beam, the d(m), R(80) and R(90) at the machine CAX had no significant change (<0.1 mm). For higher energies of 9 and 16 MeV beams, the d(m) was reduced by 0.45 and 1.63 mm per mm, between the cutout centre and the machine CAX with off-axis shift <6 mm respectively. R(80) and R(90) were reduced by more than 0.3 mm per mm off-axis shift for both energies. The isodose coverage of the in-line axis beam profile was reduced when the cutout centre was shifted away from machine CAX. It is important for oncology staff to note such dosimetric changes in the clinical electron radiotherapy, particularly when a high energy electron beam is used for small cutout. Such positional uncertainty is unavoidable in fabricating an electron cutout in the mould room
