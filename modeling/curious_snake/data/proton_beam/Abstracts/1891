At the new heavy ion tumor therapy facility of the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung at Darmstadt positron emission tomography (PET) has been implemented for in-beam and in-situ therapy control, i.e. during the tumor irradiation. The components necessary for this dedicated PET-imaging and their integration into the framework of therapy planning and quality assurance of heavy ion cancer treatments are presented. Results of the first application of this PET-method to patient treatments are reported
