The first of a new generation of microtron accelerators has been installed and tested. It is currently in use for multisegment conformal radiotherapy at our institution. The unit produces x rays and electrons from 10 to 50 MeV in 5 MeV increments. It incorporates a 64 leaf, doubly focused multileaf collimator (MLC), which can be used to shape x-ray and electron beams. Both x-ray and electron beams are produced by magnetically scanning the electron beams from the accelerator. The new generation unit incorporates a purging magnet to sweep away any primary or secondary electrons that pass through the target(s). In this paper, the beam characteristics of the accelerator that were studied during acceptance testing are described. Representative examples of depth doses, beam profiles, output factors, and elementary beam distributions are presented and discussed, in comparison with the earlier generation of microtron accelerators and with other radiotherapy machines
