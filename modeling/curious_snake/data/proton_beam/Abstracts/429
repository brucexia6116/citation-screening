Thermal photocoagulation of small peripheral angiomas is the treatment of choice for capillary hemangiomas in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Larger peripheral angiomas are better treated with beta-ray brachytherapy resulting in improved results in terms of local tumor control and the side effects of treatment. Photodynamic treatment is an alternative option in the management of capillary hemangiomas of the retina. Further improvement of the treatment results of photodynamic therapy may be achieved by combination with intravitreal drugs. External beam radiation using either stereotactic techniques or proton radiation must be considered as experimental. The treatment of juxtapapillary angiomas is still a therapeutic dilemma. Vitreoretinal surgery should be confined to advanced stages with tractional detachment or when no other treatment option is available to salvage the eye. [References: 51]
