A computer controlled multileaf collimator (MLC) is being designed to replace the multirod collimator (MRC) at present used to shape the d(48.5) + Be neutron beam from the Harper Hospital superconducting cyclotron. The computer controlled MLC will improve efficiency and allow for the future development of intensity modulated radiation therapy with neutrons. The existing MRC uses tungsten rods, while the new MLC will use steel as the leaf material. In the current study the attenuation and activation characteristics of steel are compared with those of tungsten to ensure that (a) the attenuation achieved in the MLC is at least equivalent to that of the existing MRC, and (b) that the activation of the steel will not result in a significant change in the activation levels within the treatment room. The latter point is important since personnel exposure (particularly to the radiation therapy technologists) from induced radioactivity must be minimized. Measurement of the neutron beam attenuation in a broad beam geometry showed that a 30 cm thick steel leaf yielded 2.5% transmission. This compared favorably with the 4% transmission obtained with the existing MRC. Irradiation of steel and tungsten samples at different depths in a 30 cm steel block indicated that the activation of steel should be no worse than that of tungsten
