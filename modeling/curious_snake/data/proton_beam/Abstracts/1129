INTRODUCTION: Our main goals were to study the survival of patients with uveal melanomas involving the ciliary body 5 and 10 years after treatment and to review prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study investigated 106 tumors (27 ciliary body melanomas and 79 choroidal-ciliary melanomas) of patients treated between June 1983 and April 1998. Seventy-two patients were treated with 106-ruthenium applicators and 34 were treated with proton therapy. Some large tumors or recurrences required a second treatment. The mean follow-up period was 91 months. RESULTS: The mean tumor sizes before treatment were 6,6mm for melanoma thickness and 10.3mm for mean largest basal melanoma diameters (LTD). Of the patients studied, 71% were still alive at 5 years, 35% had metastasis and 27.7% developed recurrences. Multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors for melanoma-related death were LTD greater than 13mm, presence of exudative retinal detachment, macroscopic iris root involvement at the time of diagnosis, and choroidal-ciliary location. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: With 71% of patients still alive at 5 years, this review shows that melanomas involving the ciliary body do not seem less severe than more posterior uveal tumors. Because of size differences between ciliary body melanomas and choroidal-ciliary melanomas, we cannot come to the conclusion that choroidal-ciliary melanomas have a poorer prognosis than ciliary body melanomas. Largest tumor diameter over 13mm, presence of exudative retinal detachment, and macroscopic iris root involvement at the time of diagnosis are important risk factors for melanoma-related death, as shown by the multivariate analysis
