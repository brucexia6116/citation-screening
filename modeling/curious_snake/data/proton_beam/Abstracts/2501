Clinical experience with charged particle irradiation of human cancers has been underway at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Over 150 patients have been irradiated with heavy charged particle beams including helium, carbon, neon, and argon ions. Pilot studies have included such tumor sites as glioma of the brain, carcinoma of the esophagus, carcinoma of the pancreas, carcinoma of the stomach, ocular melanoma, and carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Prospective studies are planned to investigate the improved dose localization potential (helium) and the enhanced biologic and physical dose potential (carbon, neon) in a controlled trial against the best available megavoltage irradiation techniques
