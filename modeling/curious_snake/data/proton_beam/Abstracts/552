The aim of the investigation was the study of cytogenetic effects in human blood lymphocytes of low doses of ionizing radiation in vitro. The analysis of unstable chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes after irradiation by the accelerated ions 12C with the energy 500 MeV/nucleon and LET 10.7 keV/microm was carried out. Blood samples were irradiated on Nuclotron of the High Energy Laboratory of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The doses of irradiation were in the range from 0.05 up to 1.0 Gy. Was shown that the frequency of unstable chromosome aberrations depends from the dose of ionizing radiation and can be described by linear function. At the doses 0.25-0.50 Gy the dose-independent curve was obtained for dicentrics and centric rings. The frequencies of dicentrics and centric rings as markers of the radiation action were slightly different for different donors that could be explained by different radiosensitivity. Using the calibration curve obtained earlier for gamma-rays coefficients of relative biological efficiency of accelerated 12C with the energy 500 MeV/nucleon were defined: they varied from 1.0 at the doses (0.5-1.0 Gy) up to 3.2 at the lower doses (0.05-0.25 Gy)
