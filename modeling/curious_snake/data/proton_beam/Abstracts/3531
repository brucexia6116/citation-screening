The effectiveness of a 70-MeV proton beam in the induction of chromosome aberrations was studied. We employed peripheral lymphocytes and analyzed the frequencies of dicentrics and rings after irradiation at doses ranging from 0.1 to 8.0 Gy at various depths within a Lucite phantom. The frequency of chromosome aberrations after irradiation with an unmodulated proton beam at 5 mm showed a dose-response relationship similar to that of 60Co gamma rays. However, irradiation at greater depths with the spread-out Bragg peak induced higher aberration frequencies at doses lower than those with gamma rays. Furthermore, the distribution curve of chromosome aberration frequencies as a function of depth was found to be slightly different from the physically measured depth-dose curve. With the spread-out Bragg peak the biological effects were more marked at greater depths, resulting in a distribution of relative biological effectiveness values. The results obtained from chromosome aberration analysis may not be related directly to those for the relationship between dose and cell killing. Slight differences in values for relative biological effectiveness due to the change of dose and site of proton beam irradiation may not be important for practical proton beam therapy, but may be important in the prevention of late radiation injuries
