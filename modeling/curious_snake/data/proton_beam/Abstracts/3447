We evaluated prophylactic silicone tube intubation of the nasolacrimal drainage system prior to helium ion irradiation of uveal melanomas located on the nasal side of the globe. Twelve patients received silicone tubes and were compared to a control group of 12 patients with irradiated nasal tumors without silicone tubes. Symptoms of nasolacrimal duct obstruction and epiphora were evaluated by means of a questionnaire. All patients had nasolacrimal duct irrigation. Patients intubated before irradiation maintained patency (11 of 12), whereas those in the control group did not (zero of 12) (P less than .0014); ten of 12 control patients had closure of both superior and inferior puncta. No significant difference in symptoms of epiphora was observed between the two groups
