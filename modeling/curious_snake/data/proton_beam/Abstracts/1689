In this work the extent of the linear dose response and the dynamic dose range of N-vinylpyrrolidone-argon based (VIPAR) polymer gels were investigated. VIPAR gels were irradiated using a 6 MV linear accelerator up to 60 Gy and a Nucletron microSelectron 192Ir HDR brachytherapy source to much higher doses to cover a dose range of two orders of magnitude. They were then MR scanned at 1.5 T to obtain T2-maps. VIPAR gel measurements obtained from the two irradiation regimes were calibrated against ion chamber measurements and dose calculations derived using the AAPM TG-43 protocol respectively. A satisfying agreement between the calibration results derived using the 6 MV x-rays and the 192Ir source was found for doses up to 60 Gy, implying that the response of the VIPAR gels is independent of photon energy and dose rate. A linear R2 dose response up to approximately 40 Gy and a dynamic dose range up to at least approximately 250 Gy were observed. VIPAR gel dose measurements derived using the monoexponentially fitted brachytherapy calibration data were found to be quite accurate
