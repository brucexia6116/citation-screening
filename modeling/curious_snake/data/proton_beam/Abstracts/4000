A measurement protocol providing a correct adjustment of the irradiation frequencies for well separated fat and water images of the lumbar spine is presented. To determine accurately the Larmor frequencies of water and fat protons within the vertebral bodies, a volume selective spectrum of a volume element (13 mm)3 located in a lumbar vertebral body was acquired with the 90 degrees-180 degrees-180 degrees double spin-echo method. These Larmor frequencies are used to adjust the frequency-selective pulse of the SENEX chemical-shift imaging sequence. This procedure provides well separated fat and water images for a large field of view even in the inhomogeneous region of the vertebral column. Their clinical importance is demonstrated by localized Larmor frequency-guided (LLFG) SENEX 1H images of the lumbar spine in healthy persons of different age and in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia
