An integrated system for fractionated, stereotactically guided conformation radiotherapy has been developed. The system components are a stereotactic fixation system that can be used each treatment day, a localization, and positioning unit that can be used during x-ray computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and radiographical examinations as well as for treatment. Conformal precision radiotherapy is planned with a new three-dimensional treatment planning system (Voxel-Plan-Heidelberg) which comprises, among others options, a three-dimensional image correlation procedure as well as routines for the calculation of coplanar and non-coplanar irradiations with irregularly shaped fields. Two different multi-leaf collimators have been designed for precision radiotherapy in the head and neck region. A manual multi-leaf collimator is used for irradiations with stationary beams or for moving beam treatments with invariable irregularly shaped fields. This collimator system is now being used for patient treatments. The design of a computer controlled multi-leaf collimator unit for multiple fixed field irradiation techniques is discussed. All system components are aimed at conforming dose distributions for fractionated radiotherapy treatments to the target to improve sparing of adjacent normal tissues, and at achieving a sufficient geometrical accuracy in the dose application
