Premature chromosome condensation (PCC) experiments using human lymphocytes with centromere staining have shown that after exposure to 3.45 MeV alpha-particle radiation, the full number of dicentric chromosomes appears when the cell fusion protocol is applied immediately after irradiation. In this case, the time available for repair and misrepair of DNA damage is only about 30 min. The number of dicentrics does not change with a further increase in the time available for chromatin rearrangement. This fast response confirms the expectation based on our previous experiments using PCC with 150 kV X rays in which the alpha component of the yield of dicentrics was found to appear when the cell fusion protocol was applied immediately after irradiation, whereas the beta component was delayed by several hours. The time constant for rejoining of the excess acentric chromosome fragments is found to be donor-specific and not to differ for alpha particles and X rays, but alpha-particle radiation leaves a larger fraction of the excess acentric fragments unrejoined. The RBEs of the 3.45 MeV alpha-particle radiation compared to 150 kV X rays, evaluated for the alpha component for the yield of dicentrics and for the yield of unrepaired acentric fragments, have almost equal values of about 4. This is consistent with data in the literature on chromosome aberrations observed in metaphase that show the equality of the RBE values for production of dicentrics and acentric fragments. Our experimental results concerning the fast kinetics of the alpha component of the yield of exchange-type chromosome aberrations are not consistent with Lea's pairwise lesion interaction model, and they support the proposed alternative mechanism of lesion-nonlesion interaction between chromatin regions carrying clustered DNA damage and intact chromatin regions
