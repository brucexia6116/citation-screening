The paper is concerned with the description of some technical aspects of irradiation of intraocular melanomas of the preequatorial and retroequatorial localizations with a proton beam on a synchrotron at the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. Potentialities of a program of design of irradiation of intraocular tumors were considered. The parameters of an optimized plan of irradiation were determined by analysis of computer-simulated dose topographic and anatomic situations at different variants of irradiation. Reproducibility of an optimized plan of irradiation was no worse than 1 mm
