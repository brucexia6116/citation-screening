Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) rare earth permanent magnets have unique properties that enable them to fit easily onto the accessory mount of a clinical linear accelerator to partially sweep away electron contamination produced by the treatment head and block trays and thus increase skin sparing. Using such magnets the central axis entrance surface dose has been reduced by 11% for a 20 x 30 cm field size from 32% to 21% of maximum dose by the magnetic device. A reduction of 14% from 32% to 18% was seen for a 20 x 20 cm field size with a 6 mm perspex block tray positioned above the magnet. The magnetic device is light weight and thus clinically usable
