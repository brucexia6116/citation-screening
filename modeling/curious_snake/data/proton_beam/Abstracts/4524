Forty children with Icenko-Cushing's disease were subjected to radiotherapy. Radiation of the pituitary with a proton beam in a dose of 70-100 Gy (7000-10000 rad) performed according to the indicated technique appeared highly effective. It was not associated with local or total radiation injuries and was safe. X-ray therapy conducted according to the fractionally intensive technique in a dose of 3000-3500 rad was less effective and produced disease relapses more frequently as compared with proton therapy
