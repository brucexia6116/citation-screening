Cytogenetic disorders in peripheral blood lymphocytes of humans were studied in culture following single irradiation by protons with energy of 1 GeV. Doses ranged from 0.05 to 2.0 Gy. A large number of structural damages were observed. Nature of dependence of frequency of such irradiation markers as dicentrics and centric ring was established. Relative biological coefficient of relative energy protons was calculated as 1.2
