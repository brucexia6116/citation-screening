PURPOSE: To report two cases of regional lymphatic spread of primary uveal melanoma. METHODS: The clinical records of two patients who underwent enucleation for uveal melanoma and later developed regional lymph node metastases were reviewed. One of the two eyes was initially treated with proton beam irradiation. Histologic sections of the enucleated eyes and excised lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: The melanomas arose in the choroid and ciliary body of the two patients and spread to regional lymph nodes 2 years after enucleation. The choroidal melanoma recurred after irradiation, diffusely infiltrated the uveal tract, and extended into the conjunctiva via an emissary canal. The ciliary body melanoma spread through the trabecular meshwork to the conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal and ciliary body melanoma may rarely exhibit regional lymph node metastasis. This mode of metastasis may occur after extraocular spread and invasion of conjunctival lymphatics
