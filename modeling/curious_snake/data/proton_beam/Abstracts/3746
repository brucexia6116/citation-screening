The output beams of fast electrons and high energy fotons of a linear accelerator Mevatron KD 80/67 provide broad spectrum of therapeutic application. The properties of static fields of bremsstrahlung, modification of dose distribution by means of wedge filters, properties and advantages of asymmetric diaphragms and possibilities of shaping the irradiation fields are described. Dose distribution in rotation therapy with bremsstrahlung is presented. In electron beams the author presents cohorts of selected isodoses of static fields for all energies and define important therapeutic values. A possibility of shaping basic fields and the use of rotation therapy with electron beam is suggested
