If low LET radiation therapy (photons, electrons), following radical microscopically and complete surgery can improve results in term of local control from 34 to 74% for salivary gland tumors, local control is more difficult to achieve in advanced tumors and only palliative treatment is usually attempted. In this survey, all the patient series treated worldwide were reviewed. They show an overall control rate of 31% with photon vs 64% with neutron therapy. A prospective randomised trial sponsored by the RTOG and the MRC published in 1988 and reviewed in 1993 showed an overall locoregional complete tumor clearance of 67% for neutrons and 17% for photons (P < 0.005), with 68% and 25% survival at two years for neutrons and photons respectively. This study was closed for ethical reasons. In Orleans, since 1987, 59 patients have been treated. At five years the persistent local control probability was 69.5%, the five-year crude survival probability 66% and the five-year tumor free survival probability was 64.5%. This review provides evidence that surgical treatment for salivary gland tumors should be limited to patients presenting a high likelihood of negative surgical margin and a small risk of facial nerve damage. Others patients should receive neutron radiation therapy alone as definitive treatment. [References: 61]
