The TBI is performed with 8 MV X-rays of a linear accelerator. The procedure is divided into a lateral and a.p./p.a. segment with a weighting factor of 5/6 and 1/6 respectively. For the lateral segment no compensators are employed. Only the upper part of the arms are used to shield the lungs. In the a.p./p.a. segment two or three fields have to be used on account of the small FSD. Here head and neck are shielded depending on the overdosage in the lateral segment. The dose given to the lungs is limited by mantlefield-technique to 10.5 Gy. The total midline dose amounts to 12 Gy and is applicated on three days with two fractions per day
