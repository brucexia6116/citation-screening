As a part of an on-site physics review procedure, the Midwest Center for Radiological Physics (MWCRP) interviewed midwest clinical radiotherapy physicists and radiation therapists in institutions that participated in federally funded Cancer Control Programs. Information from 77 institutions was compiled regarding types of megavoltage units, daily patient load, radiotherapy personnel, treatment planning responsibilities, dosimetric practices, and treatment planning computers. Even though some practices, such as frequency of patient charge checks, were consistent throughout the midwest, other practices varied considerably such as patient load with the number of megavoltage units. This information may be useful either for planning a new facility, considering the needs for staff, or for comparing existing practices and responsibilities
