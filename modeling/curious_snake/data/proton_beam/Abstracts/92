This book on the therapeutic applications of neutrons and high-LET radiations in cancer therapy would not have been complete without a review of the present situation of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and a discussion of its future perspectives. BNCT is a special type of high-LET radiation therapy that attempts to achieve a selectivity at the cellular level. The rationale is to incorporate boron atoms selectively in the cancer cells and then bombard those atoms with thermal neutrons to produce a neutron capture reaction and subsequent decay that emits alpha and lithium particles. The efficiency of the technique depends upon achieving selective incorporation of the boron atoms in the cancer cells and not (or to a lesser extent) in the normal cells. The present status and future directions are described, with emphasis on boron carriers (drugs) and their delivery, as well as physical and treatment planning aspects. [References: 102]
