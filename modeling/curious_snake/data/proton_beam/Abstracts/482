High-energy beams of (12)C ions in the range of 80-430 MeV u(-1) delivered by the heavy-ion synchrotron SIS-18 are used for radiotherapy of deep-seated localized tumors at the treatment unit at GSI Darmstadt. In order to improve the physical database, the fragmentation characteristics along the penetration path in tissue were investigated experimentally by using a water phantom as tissue-equivalent absorber. Measurements were performed at specific energies of 200 and 400 MeV u(-1) of the incident (12)C ions and at six different depths before and behind the Bragg peak. Secondary fragments with nuclear charges Z(f) = 1-5 were identified by scintillation detectors using DeltaE-E and time-of-flight techniques. The preliminary results include energy- and angular distributions, fragment yields, build-up curves and attenuation of the primary carbon projectiles
