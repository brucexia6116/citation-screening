This article presents a comparison between two implementations of an EGS4 Monte Carlo simulation of a radiation therapy machine. The first implementation was run on a high performance RISC workstation, and the second was run on an inexpensive PC. The simulation was performed using the MCRAD user code. The photon energy spectra, as measured at a plane transverse to the beam direction and containing the isocenter, were compared. The photons were also binned radially in order to compare the variation of the spectra with radius. With 500,000 photons recorded in each of the two simulations, the running times were 48 h and 116 h for the workstation and the PC, respectively. No significant statistical differences between the two implementations were found
