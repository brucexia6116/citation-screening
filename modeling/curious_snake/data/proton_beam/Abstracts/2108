Probabilities for secondary cancer incidence have been estimated for a patient with Hodgkin's disease for whom treatment has been planned with different radiation modalities using photons and protons. The ICRP calculation scheme has been used to calculate cancer incidence from dose distributions. For this purpose, target volumes as well as critical structures have been outlined in the CT set of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Dose distributions have been calculated using conventional as well as intensity-modulated treatment techniques using photon and proton radiation. The cancer incidence has been derived from the mean doses for each organ. The results of this work are: (a) Intensity-modulated treatment of Hodgkin's disease using nine photon fields (15 MV) results in nearly the same cancer incidence as treating with two opposed photon fields (6 MV). (b) Intensity-modulated treatment using nine proton fields (maximum energy 177.25 MeV) results in nearly the same cancer incidence as treating with one proton field (160 MeV). (c) Irradiation with protons using the spot scanning technique decreases the avoidable cancer incidence compared to photon treatment by a factor of about two. This result is independent of the number of beams used. Our work suggests that there are radiotherapy indications in which intensity-modulated treatments will result in little or no reduction of cancer incidence compared to conventional treatments. However, proton treatment can result in a lower cancer incidence than photon treatment
