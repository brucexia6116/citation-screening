The dose-volume histogram of the target volume during intracavitary irradiation in cases of uterine cervical cancer was calculated from diagnostic computed tomography data in order to study the correlation with prognosis. The minimum dose applied to the target volume was most closely related with the prognosis. However, for the actual planning of three-dimensional treatment, a dose of 80% of the volume of the dose-integration volume curve, on which the histogram was integrated in the order of high dose, was recommended as an index dose for dose optimization
