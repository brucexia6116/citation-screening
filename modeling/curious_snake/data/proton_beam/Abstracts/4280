In recent years, new types of ionizing radiations have been used as an attractive modality in cancer treatments. Low LET radiation such as protons and helium ions has the advantage of a high physical selectivity of irradiation. Clinical results have confirmed that they are of benefit in certain types of cancer. High LET particles such as fast neutrons, heavy ions (carbon, neon) and negative pions possess higher radiobiological effects (RBE). Moreover, the latter two particles have an advantage of improved dose distribution. The clinical indications for protons are those located in close vicinity to the critical normal organs, and those for fast neutrons are relatively superficial tumors. Further studies are needed to determine indications for pions. The available clinical experience in selected tumors with protons, pions and fast neutrons justifies the heavy-ion therapy programs. Successful results are anticipated from HIMAC (Heavy ion medical accelerator in Chiba) which is a dedicated facility for heavy-ion therapy. [References: 22]
