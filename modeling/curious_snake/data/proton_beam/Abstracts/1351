BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to evaluate clinical results and complications of a combination of proton and photon irradiation administered to 17 children with selected central nervous system (CNS) tumors. PROCEDURE: Between July 1994 and September 2000, 17 children, aged from 5 to 17 years (median: 12 years) with intracranial benign (6 cases) or malignant (11 cases) tumors, were treated with photons (median dose: 40 Gy; 24-54) and protons (median dose: 20 CGE; 9-31) at the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 27 months (3-81). Two patients recurred locally (one marginal and one in situ). Fifteen patients are alive and doing well. Overall, 12, 24, and 36-month local control rate was 92 +/- 8% and, 12, 24, and 36-month overall survival rates were 93 +/- 6%, 83 +/- 11%, and 83 +/- 11%, respectively. Clinical initial symptoms remained stable or subsided in all patients. Early toxicities were in the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: With a mean 27 months follow-up, protontherapy was well tolerated for doses upto 69 CGE and with an excellent local control rate. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc
