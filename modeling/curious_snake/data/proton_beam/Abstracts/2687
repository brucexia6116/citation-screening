The cell cycle, the growth fraction and cell loss influence the response of cells to radiation in many ways. The variation in radiosensitivity around the cell cycle, and the extent of radiation-induced delay in cell cycle progression have both been clearly demonstrated in vitro. This translates into a variable time of expression of radiation injury in different normal tissues, ranging from a few days in intestine to weeks, months or even years in slowly proliferating tissues like lung, kidney, bladder and spinal cord. The radiosensitivity of tumours, to single doses, is dominated by hypoxic cells which arise from the imbalance between tumour cell production and the proliferation and branching of the blood vessels needed to bring oxygen and other nutrients to each cell. The response to fractionated radiation schedules is also influenced by the cell kinetic parameters of the cells comprising each tissue or tumour. This is described in terms of repair, redistribution, reoxygenation and repopulation. Slowly cycling cells show much more curved underlying cell survival curves, leading to more dramatic changes with fractionation, dose rate or l.e.t. Rapidly cycling cells redistribute around the cell cycle when the cells in sensitive phases have been killed, and experience less mitotic delay than slowly proliferating cells. Reoxygenation seems more effective in tumours with rapidly cycling cells and high natural cell loss rates. Compensatory repopulation within a treatment schedule may spare skin and mucosa but does not spare slowly proliferating tissues. Furthermore, tumour cell proliferation during fractionated radiotherapy may be an important factor limiting the overall success of treatment. [References: 71]
