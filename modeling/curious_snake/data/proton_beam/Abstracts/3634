Linear accelerators use water cooling systems to ensure that certain components operate at specific temperatures. The water cooling system used on a Siemens Mevatron 77 has been found by us to be inadequate for our purposes for three major reasons. First, the controller is not able to regulate the machine temperature accurately when the beam is on for more than 10 min. Second, there is a high risk of failure at our site due to a high level of impurities in the utility water, and finally, changes in the temperature of the utility water necessitate adjustments to the temperature controller. A microprocessor-based temperature controller has been designed and built for use with a Mevatron 77. The three areas of concern mentioned have been eliminated by the use of the new controller
