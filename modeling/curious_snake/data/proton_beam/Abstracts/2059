The crystalline substance ammonium tartrate is investigated with respect to its suitability as a clinical dosimetry material. The properties investigated are: the radical stability for absorbed doses relevant for clinical use, the improvement in sensitivity when the crystals are deuterated and the linear electron transfer (LET)-dependence. After photon irradiation to an absorbed dose of 20 Gy, the signal increases rapidly during the first 6 h. After this period, the changes are more moderate and can be corrected for. The signal-to-noise ratio of irradiated ammonium tartrate is twice the corresponding value of alanine. By deuterating the crystals, the sensitivity can be further improved by a factor of 1.4. As expected, the signal decreases with increasing LET of the radiation, but no changes in the spectrum shape was observed
