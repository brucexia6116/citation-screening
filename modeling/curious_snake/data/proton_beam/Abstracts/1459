Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease which reduces the quality of life and leads to disability in approximately one-third of the patients. The spectrum of therapeutic modalities is limited. The renaissance of the use of (224)Ra-radium chloride for AS treatment, however, gives rise to concern which should result in the reconsideration of (224)Ra dosimetry and in the discussion of the risks associated with this treatment. The present study introduces new dosimetric calculations for alpha and beta/gamma rays performed according to the model proposed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). After a treatment schedule of 10 intravenous injections, each with 1 MBq of (224)Ra, the absorbed doses were calculated to be highest on the bone surface of the patient (4.4 Gy) with a resulting effective dose of 2.5 Sv
