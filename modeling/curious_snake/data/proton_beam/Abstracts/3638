A maze design is discussed for a Therac 20 linear accelerator (manufactured by Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd.) which reduces the flux of neutrons at the door to permissible levels in controlled areas. The L-shaped design allows for a relatively light door at the end of the maze, consisting of 5.08-cm (2-in.) borated polyethylene and 2-mm lead. A comparison is made between the neutron dose equivalent (DE) calculated by various methods and the DE measured with a variety of portable neutron survey meters. In addition, the neutron energy spectrum outside the maze at 1 m from the door, measured with a polyethylene multisphere LiI system, is reported
