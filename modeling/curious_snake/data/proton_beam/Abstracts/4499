The application of a novel multirod collimator in fast neutron therapy to produce irregularly shaped fields with partial transmission and fully blocked areas is discussed. The transmission through the tungsten rods is measured in free space in broad beam geometry. A model based on scatter analysis is applied in calculating the thickness of the rods required to produce partially blocked areas. The effect of a full beam block is also measured. Measurements have been made in a water phantom to confirm the computational model. The good agreement between the measured and calculated values demonstrates that the scatter model can be safely applied to fast neutron beam dose computations
