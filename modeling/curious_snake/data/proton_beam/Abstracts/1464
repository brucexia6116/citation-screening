The thermal and thermo-mechanical (fatigue) properties of a stationary-anode kilovoltage x-ray source that can be integrated into the head of a medical linear accelerator have been modeled. A finite element program has been used to model two new target designs. The first design makes minor modifications to the existing target assembly of a Varian medical linear accelerator, while the second design adds an additional cooling tube, changes the target angle, and uses a tungsten-rhenium alloy rather than tungsten as the kilovoltage target material. The thermal calculations have been used to generate cyclic stress/strain values from which estimates of fatigue in the target designs have been made. Both kilovoltage and megavoltage operation have been studied. Analysis of the megavoltage operation shows that there are only small differences in the thermal and fatigue characteristics after the target assembly is modified to include a kilovoltage target. Thus, megavoltage operation should not be compromised. The first kilovoltage target design can handle a 900 W heat load (e.g., 120 kVp, 7.5 mA, 2 x 2 mm2 source size); the heat load being limited by the temperature at the surface of the cooling tubes and mechanical fatigue at the surface of the target. The second design can handle a 1250 W heat load (e.g., 120 kVp, approximately 10.4 mA, 2 x 2 mm2 source size). Our calculations show that installation of a kilovoltage x-ray target is practical from thermal and thermo-mechanical perspectives
