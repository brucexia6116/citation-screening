A radioactive check source is recommended for operational and constancy checks of dosimetry systems used for the calibration of therapeutic x-ray generators, including linear accelerators. Eight years of data have been analyzed for two ion chambers (and their associated electrometers) irradiated at fixed geometry in such a device. These dosimetry systems have also been calibrated every 2 years at a single Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Laboratory. Our analysis suggests that when a check source is used, and the results are consistent, the interval between formal calibrations can be lengthened
