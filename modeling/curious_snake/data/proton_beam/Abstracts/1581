Proton electron double resonance imaging (PEDRI) uses the Overhauser effect to image the distribution of free-radicals in biological samples and animals. Standard MRI hardware and software is used, with the addition of hardware to irradiate the free-radical-of-interest's EPR resonance. For in vivo applications it must be implemented at a sufficiently low magnetic field to result in an EPR irradiation frequency that will penetrate the sample but will not cause excessive nonresonant power deposition therein. Many clinical MRI systems use resistive magnets that are capable of operating at 10-20 mT, and which could thus be used as PEDRI imagers with the addition of a small amount of extra hardware. This article describes the conversion of a 0.38 T whole-body MRI system for operation as a 20.1 mT small-animal PEDRI imager. The magnet power supply control electronics required a small modification to operate at the lower field strength, but no permanent hardware changes to the MRI console were necessary, and no software modification was required. Frequency down- and up-conversion was used on the NMR RF system, together with a new NMR/EPR dual-resonance RF coil assembly. The system was tested on phantoms containing free-radical solution, and was also used to image the distribution of a free-radical contrast agent injected intravenously into anesthetized mice.
