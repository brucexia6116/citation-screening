Radiotherapy of patients with prostate cancer offers an alternative to radical prostatectomy in early stages (T1-T2). In locally advanced prostate cancer a high dose or combined radiotherapy is more effective than radical surgery with concurrent lower morbidity and mortality. Recent developments in linear accelerator technique, the progress in dose calculation and planning techniques provide the means to apply higher doses to a given tumor volume while effectively protecting the surrounding normal tissue at the same time. These improvements may possibly reduce the rate of therapy related side effects or complications significantly. The combination of external beam radiotherapy and interstitial brachytherapy as well as the combination of hormone therapy and external beam radiotherapy are most likely more effective than percutaneous irradiation alone. In special cases with a very low risk of recurrent tumor an interstitial permanent brachytherapy alone is indicated. Future developments (i.e. intensity modulated radiotherapy-IMRT, combined thermo-radiotherapy, proton- or neutrontherapy) may further increase the rate of curative treatments in patients with prostate cancer.
