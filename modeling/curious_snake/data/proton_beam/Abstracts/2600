Fast neutrons, produced in a spallation process by 72 MeV protons hitting heavy nuclei, can be moderated down to keV energies, suitable for 10B capture therapy. Measurements of neutron flux from copper and lead targets, after moderation by water and hydrocarbons, have been performed, together with measurements of the fast neutron and gamma-backgrounds. The comparisons with Monte Carlo calculations show good agreement. As neutron fluences up to 10(12) to 10(13)n/cm2 can be produced within a few hours in about 0.5 m target distance the technique seems to be suitable for clinical experiments
