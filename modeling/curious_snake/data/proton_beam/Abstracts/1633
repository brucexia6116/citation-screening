With the utilization of new biologic agents and experimental chemotherapy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, the issue of local-regional control will become increasingly important. This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of dose escalation using proton therapy, as compared to conventional 3-dimensional conformal radiation, by minimizing the dose to normal tissues. The photon treatment plans of 4 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer treated on a biologic therapy trial were utilized. Each patient was treated using a 3- or 4-field photon plan with 45 Gy to the clinical target volume (CTV), followed by a boost of 14.4 Gy to the gross target volume (GTV). Using a Helax treatment planning system, proton plans were generated to encompass the same CTV and GTV to the same prescribed dose. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were generated for the GTV, CTV, spinal cord, liver, and right and left kidneys. Each DVH was compared between the photon and proton plans. Proton plans utilized either a 2- or 3-field technique. Available energies included 130 or 180 MeV. Range modulators and bolus were used as needed to conform to the target volume. With the CTV and GTV receiving the same dose from the proton and photon plans, all individual proton plans were superior to the photon plans in reduction of normal tissue dose. For the 4 patients, the average dose reduction to 50% of the organ at risk was 78% to spinal cord (p = 0.003), 73% to left kidney (p = 0.025), 43% to right kidney (p = 0.059), and 55% to liver (p = 0.061). These comparative treatment plans show proton therapy results in significant reductions of dose to normal tissue compared to conventional photons while treating the same target volumes. This allows for the design of dose-escalation protocols using protons in combination with new biologic therapies and chemotherapy
