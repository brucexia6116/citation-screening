The treatment strategy for malignant liver tumors should be appropriately determined because post-treatment quality of life greatly depends on the patients' residual hepatic function. In this report, we present three patients with malignant liver tumors treated by proton beam therapy in whom pre- and post-therapeutic hepatic functional reserves were evaluated sequentially for more than a year by 99mTechnetium-galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) scintigraphy. All three patients exhibited the distinctive time course of 99mTc-GSA uptake efficiency, which suggested a transient decline in the ratio of liver activity to heart and liver activity at 15 minutes (LHL15) 3-6 months after proton beam therapy. This change was not in parallel with that expected from a functioning normal liver tissue volume. In a year after proton beam therapy, LHL15 recovered nearly to the pre-treatment level in all three patients. Our observations may be related to the up-regulation of receptor-mediated 99mTc-GSA uptake during hepatic regeneration after proton beam therapy. [References: 27]
