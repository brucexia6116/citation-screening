In the present stage between the technological realization and the clinical phase, quality management gains a predominant role at the heavy ion therapy facility at GSI. Specific quality inspection procedures had to be developed for the subsequent parts of the beam delivery system, the treatment planning, the raster scanning device, the patient positioning, the dose verification and the safety interlock system. In the meantime the acceptance test of the whole facility has been carried out and an overview about our first experience with quality assurance procedures at the heavy ion irradiation facility is given, with a special emphasis on the medical physics part
