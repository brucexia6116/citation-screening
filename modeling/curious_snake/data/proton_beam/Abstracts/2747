We present results of some calculations that convert double-strand breaks to dicentrics by means of a repair-misrepair model. The method uses Monte Carlo techniques to determine the positions of the double-strand breaks and to determine the dicentric yields for comparison with those obtained experimentally in human lymphocytes following irradiation in G0. The model is able to describe the linear-quadratic curves of dicentric yield following low LET irradiation, but underpredicts by a factor of about 1.5-2.0 the high LET neutron curves. The effects of including corrections for interphase death are demonstrated. The reasons for the discrepancy at high LET are discussed and suggestions for an improvement to the fit are made
