The technique of stereotactic proton radiosurgery is discussed in depth in this article. The physics of the proton beam in radiosurgery is explained, and the different factors of beam delivery are examined. These key factors (correspondence to shape, accuracy of delineation of volume, correspondence to volume, and accuracy of delivery vary) with each of the radiosurgical techniques, from Gamma Knife surgery to linear accelerator therapy. Clinical series in the use of proton radiosurgery are also presented, with an emphasis on efficacy and uses
