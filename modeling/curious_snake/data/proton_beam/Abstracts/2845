It could be demonstrated that local tumor control is considerably improved by radiation therapy with charged particles (protons or heavier ions). The advantages of heavy ion therapy compared to conventional photon therapy techniques are due to the better physical dose distributions achievable and the radiobiological characteristics of heavy ions. However, because of the expense and complexity of heavy ion therapy it is only carried out at a few facilities throughout the world. The Radiologische Universitatsklinik (Radiological University Hospital) and the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (German Cancer Research Centre, DKFZ) in Heidelberg, in collaboration with the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (Laboratory for Heavy Ion, GSI) in Darmstadt, have developed a concept to use the new heavy ion synchrotron (Schwerionen-Synchroton SIS) in Darmstadt for medical-clinical irradiations. Due to the high flexibility of the SIS accelerator the medical program can be performed in addition to the planned physical experiments with minor interference only. The close geographical proximity of the three institutes involved and the accelerator which will be completed by the end of 1989 provide the unique opportunity to carry out relevant clinical, medical-physical, physical-technical, and radiobiological research in a relatively short time and, compared to similar projects in other countries, at low cost
