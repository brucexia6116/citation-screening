The management of posterior uveal melanoma has evolved tremendously for the past decades and, more recently, there is a trend toward more focal conservative treatment. Transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) with infrared diode laser (810 nm.) is the newest modality used as primary treatment or as complementary method to radiotherapy or surgical resection in very selected cases of choroidal melanoma. Plaque radiotherapy or charged-particle irradiation is particularly recommended for medium- or small-sized uveal melanoma not suitable to TTT or resection. Special custom-designed plaque radiotherapy (iodine-125) can be used for iris, ciliary body or juxta-paillary choroidal melanoma. The tumor control rate after plaque or charged-particle radiotherapy appears to be similar, but charged-particle irradiation may produce worse anterior segment complications than plaque radiotherapy. Stereotatic radiation therapy for choroidal melanomas may be effective in controlling tumor growth but the number of patients treated with the approach is too small to draw strong conclusions. Local tumor resection using trans-scleral resection is mainly suitable for selected iris, ciliary body, or anterior choroidal melanoma, particularly with smaller basal dimensions and greater thickness. Combined therapies (radiotherapy plus TTT, tumor resection plus TTT) appears to be more effective in decreasing the incidence of intraocular tumor recurrence. Enucleation is still performed for large uveal melanoma when there is no hope for useful vision. Based on the published ophthalmic literature, it seems that enucleation carries the same survival prognosis as each of the conservative treatment modalities. [References: 16]
