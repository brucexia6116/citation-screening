Radiotherapy has been developed by the support of physics, technology and biology. Considering the present projects in radiation oncology from these respects, modern brachytherapy and conformation radiotherapy are based on the advancement of physics and technology, whereas high LET radiotherapy and hyperthermia are mainly supported by modern radiobiology. However, for evaluation of these subjects further clinical trials in high LET radiotherapy and a further technical development in hyperthermia are essential
