Stereotaxic proton beam therapy using narrow beams (5-10 mm at 50% of isodose) at the energy of 100 MeV in single irradiation and the delivery of absorbed doses, the maximum dosage being 40-80 Gy, was provided to 99 patients with arteriovenous brain aneurysms. An analysis of the therapeutic results based on angiography data was performed in 50 patients with arteriovenous malformations with the volume up to 10 cm3. A positive effect was obtained in 31 of 50 patients
