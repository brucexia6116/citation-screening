A study was made of the dependence of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and isoeffective dose of fast neutrons (produced by U-120 cyclotron) upon the depth of the exposed tissue. It was shown that the isoeffective dose and RBE vary significantly with the depth of the tissue-equivalent medium. The investigations were carried out with the purpose of improving the radiobiological and dosimetric techniques for the treatment of malignant tumors using a neutron beam from U-120 cyclotron
