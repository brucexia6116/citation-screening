Radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were analyzed by separating large DNA fragments by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Human U-343MG glioma and K562 erythroleukemia cells were irradiated with 60Co gamma rays or nitrogen ions with high linear energy transfer (125 keV/microm). By comparing the fraction of DNA released into the gel below different size thresholds, corresponding to megabase-pair-sized DNA fragments, the relative effectiveness of the nitrogen ions was found to be dependent on both dose and the threshold size used in the evaluation. This dose dependence was most evident for the smallest threshold (6 Mbp) and was due to a linear dose response for release of the fragments for the ions compared to the curvilinear response for the gamma rays. The two curves intersected, and the relative yield of fragments (nitrogen ions/gamma rays) decreased from more than 3 below 1.5 Gy to 0.8 at 30 Gy. For the larger sizes (6-10.5 Mbp), the relative yield was constant at around 0.7. Thus the ion-induced fragments were shifted to smaller sizes compared to the 60Co gamma rays, and the data for nitrogen ions could not be fitted to random fragment distributions at doses < or =20 Gy. From these results, we conclude that a substantial fraction of the DSBs induced by heavy ions were nonrandomly distributed, correlated with DSBs within a region of < or =2 Mbp. After a dose of 20 Gy, the rejoining curves for ion-induced DSBs were different for each fragment size, resulting in different levels of unrejoined breaks after 6 h
