The authors described methods of the individual precision anatomodosimetric planning of proton-beam irradiation of tumors of the cavernous sinus. The results of computerized tomography in 2 planes (axial and frontal) were used for planning. Manual tumor reconstruction with subsequent dose planning was done on direct and lateral telecraniograms. The procedure was tested in 25 patients. Complications and noticeable radiation reactions in adjacent tissues were undetectable during 3.5 yrs
