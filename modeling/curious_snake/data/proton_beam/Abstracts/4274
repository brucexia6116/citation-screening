Methods have recently been developed for using standard linear accelerators to perform stereotactic radiosurgery. The accuracy necessary to perform this procedure requires an intensive quality assurance program to encompass all aspects of dose calibration and mechanical integrity of the treatment unit, the treatment planning process, and treatment delivery. The programs developed at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy (JCRT) include testing of the linear accelerator and the stereotactic system, cross checking of the treatment planning process, and a quality assurance check list of the treatment delivery procedure. This report outlines in detail the quality assurance program currently in use at the JCRT
