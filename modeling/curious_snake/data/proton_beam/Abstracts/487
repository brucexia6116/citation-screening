BACKGROUND: This review was performed to describe recent innovations in the radiation therapy of lung cancer. METHODS: The literature was reviewed regarding recent research in the therapy of lung cancer. Emphasis was placed on newer radiation therapy (RT) techniques. RESULTS: Advances in physics and computer technology have improved radiation delivery systems. New strategies have been used, such as altered fractionation patterns, three-dimensional treatment planning, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), tomotherapy, stereotactic RT, and heavy ion RT. New technologies will make it possible to administer higher doses more precisely, which should result in better disease control, with less toxicity. CONCLUSION: Further research will improve the outcome of patients with lung cancer by providing more effective tools for the RT of this disease. [References: 41]
