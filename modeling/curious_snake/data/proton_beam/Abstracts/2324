The epidemic form of Kaposi's sarcoma is the most frequent tumor in sieropositive patients. Every part of the body including oral cavity is affected by these lesions. According to modern acknowledgement in treating oropharynge carcinoma, radiotherapy is used for management of oral Kaposi's sarcoma. This paper reports a study of 10 patients suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma correlated to AIDS (EKS) treated with radiotherapy and chemiotherapy, achieving good results, at the Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori of Milan (Divisone di Radioterapia C) from 1988 to 1992. Treatment has been performed using linear accelerator (6 Mev) or Co 60 unity in order to reach the deepest layer of mucosa lesions. Radiotherapy schedule consisted of 150-200 cGy daily fractions given 5 times/week (w) for 4-5 w in split-course. [References: 62]
