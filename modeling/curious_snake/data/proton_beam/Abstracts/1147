After breast-conservative surgery, radiation therapy delivered to the whole breast to 50 Gy with an additional boost of 10 to 16 Gy is the standard of care. Based upon data showing that the vast majority of the recurrences occur within and surrounding the original tumor site and in order to reduce the morbidity of whole breast radiotherapy and to give the treatment in a shorter time, partial breast irradiation has been developed by several institutions. Partial breast radiotherapy is given by intraoperative radiotherapy (photons or electrons), or brachytherapy (low dose rate or high dose rate) or external radiotherapy using 3D conformal radiation therapy. This is a review of the literature data on this topic. [References: 33]
