An independent primary dose counter or totalizer has been developed for our linear accelerator. This counter is reset independently of the control console and thus will totalize the number of monitor units (MUs) delivered to the patient. This is especially useful for patients being treated at extended distances when it is necessary to reset the control console several times. The independent totalizer does not load down the control console dosimetry circuit and can be adapted to the digital logic used. The details of the system will be presented
