A simple algorithm is presented for planar image registration and the method is applied to the simulator and portal image registration for patient setup verification in radiation therapy. Basically, the algorithm follows the concept proposed by Balter et al. [Med. Phys. 19, 329-334 (1992)], which converts the problem of open curve registration into matching a series of points along the curves. Balter's algorithm consists of three steps: (1) to determine a common starting point for each curve pair, (2) acquire two corresponding point sets along each curve, and (3) obtain a global transform matrix by matching two point sets. We integrate all three steps into one simple procedure which fits the sampled points along the intended curve pair by taking the relative path length shift as an independent fitting parameter. After being modified, the algorithm is able to take the different magnification factors of images into account, and it avoids curvature calculations. Numerical simulation as well as clinical and phantom images have been utilized to test the accuracy of the algorithm. The typical errors are less than 1 mm in translation and 1 degree in rotation. We also made a comparison study with the chamfer method. The results of the two methods agree to within 0.5 mm in translation and 0.5 degree in rotation
