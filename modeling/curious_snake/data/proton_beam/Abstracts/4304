Between 1979 and 1989, 17 patients with unfavorable bone sarcoma were treated wholly or in part with heavy charged particle irradiation (helium and/or neon ions) at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The majority of tumors were located near critical structures such as the spinal cord or brain. Gross tumor was present in all but two patients at the time of irradiation. Six patients were treated for recurrent disease. Histologies included osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and recurrent osteoblastoma. Four of the osteosarcomata were believed to have been induced by previous therapeutic irradiation for various tumors. Follow-up time since initiation of radiation ranged from 7 to 118 months (median 40 months). The 5-year Kaplan-Maier local control rate was 48%; the corresponding survival rate was 41%. Over half the patients succumbed to distant metastases despite the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, we have shown that heavy charged particle irradiation can be effectively used for control of bone sarcoma. A Phase II trial is warranted to determine optimal treatment for unresectable or gross residual disease
