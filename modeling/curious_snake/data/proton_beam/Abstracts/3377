The dose distribution of the 42 MV X-ray bremsstrahlung of the betatron is represented by reference dose, depth dose and transverse dose. The method used to determine the parameters of a system of functions to approximate reference dose and depth dose is described and the coefficient schemes of the functions are indicated. The standardized equivalent field surface and the opening ratio of the useful radiation stop of the betatron serve as variables for the approximation
