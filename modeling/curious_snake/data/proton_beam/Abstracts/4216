To assess the usefulness of proton beams for treatment of patients with rectal cancer, we have performed comparative 3D treatment planning for proton beam and x-ray beam therapy. Three common x-ray techniques (AP-PA, 3-field, and 4-field box), a proton beam only plan, and a proton boost plan were compared. The plan which would have been treated without the aid of the 3D planning system was also simulated. Dose distributions were analyzed and dose-volume histograms computed for the target volumes and critical normal tissues. Analyses of these plans demonstrate that the proton beam techniques reduce the volume of small bowel irradiated. This may allow higher doses to be delivered to the tumor, with a probable increase in local control, or a reduction in normal tissue complications probability. All the plans developed with the 3D planning system treated significantly less bowel than the one planned without it
