Orbital radiation therapy appears to be an effective and safe treatment of Graves' ophthalmopathy. Five patients with Graves' ophtalmopathy were treated with external beam radiotherapy during 1996 and 1997 in St. Ann University Hospital. Four of them patients had a past history of hyperthyreoidism, one hypothyreoidism. The radiotherapy was performed with high-energy beam of a linear accelerator. The technique of irradiation employs 2 opposed beams tilted 5 degrees posteriorly. The use of the asymetric jaws is necessary to protect surrounding normal tissues. A course of radiotherapy 20.0 Gy (2.0 Gy per fraction) was given to the patients. The therapy was well tolerated. We have not observed any side late effects of radiotherapy. All patients showed good or excellent responses. The improvement of symptoms appeared within 3-6 months after the irradiation
