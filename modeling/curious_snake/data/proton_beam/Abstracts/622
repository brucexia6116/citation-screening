Dosimetry verification is an important step during intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT). The verification is usually conducted with measurements and independent dose calculations. However, currently available independent dose calculation methods were developed for step-and-shoot beam delivery methods, and their uses for dynamic multi-leaf collimator (MLC) delivery methods are not efficient. In this study, a dose calculation method was developed to perform independent dose verifications for a dynamic MLC-based IMRT technique for Varian linear accelerators. This method extracts the machine delivery parameters from the dynamic MLC (DMLC) files generated by the IMRT treatment planning system. Based on the parameters a monitor unit (MU) matrix was separately calculated as two terms: direct exposure from the open MLC field and leakage contributions, where the leaf-end leakage contribution becomes more important in higher dose gradient regions. The MU matrix was used to compute the primary dose and the scattered dose with a modified Clarkson technique. The doses computed using the method were compared with both measurement and treatment planning for 14 and 25 plans respectively. An average of less than 2% agreement was observed and the standard deviation was about 1.9%
