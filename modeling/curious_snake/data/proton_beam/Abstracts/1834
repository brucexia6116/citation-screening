A two-dimensionally position sensitive dosimetry system has been tested for different dosimetric applications in a radiation therapy facility with a scanning proton beam. The system consists of a scintillating (fluorescent) screen, mounted at the beam-exit side of a phantom and it is observed by a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The observed light distribution at the screen is equivalent to the two-dimensional (2D)-dose distribution at the screen position. It has been found that the dosimetric properties of the system, measured in a scanning proton beam, are equal to those measured in a proton beam broadened by a scattering system. Measurements of the transversal dose distribution of a single pencil beam are consistent with dose measurements as well as with dose calculations in clinically relevant fields made with multiple pencil beams. Measurements of inhomogeneous dose distributions have shown to be of sufficient accuracy to be suitable for the verification of dose calculation algorithms. The good sensitivity and sub-mm spatial resolution of the system allows for the detection of deviations of a few percent in dose from the expected (intended or calculated) dose distribution. Its dosimetric properties and the immediate availability of the data make this device a useful tool in the quality control of scanning proton beams
