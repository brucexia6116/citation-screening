Electron spectral reconstruction of medical accelerators from measured depth doses is a practical method for providing the input initial phase space distribution at the patient surface that is required by Monte Carlo treatment planning systems. The posed inverse problem of spectral reconstruction is ill conditioned and this may lead to nonphysical oscillations in the reconstructed spectra. Use of a variational method of solution with a regularization technique removes the oscillations but tends to smooth the sharp (deltalike) energy peak that is a common feature in electron spectra generated by medical accelerators. Because the sharp peak contains a large percentage of the electrons in the spectrum, an accurate estimate of the peak width, height and position is critical to the success of the technique for spectrum reconstruction with regularization. We propose use of an adaptive regularization term as a special form of the general Tichonov regularization function. The variational method with the adaptive regularization term is applied to reconstruct electron spectra for the 6, 9, and 18 MeV electron beams of a Varian Clinac 2100C accelerator and proves to be a very simple, effective and accurate approach. Results using this variational method with adaptive regularization almost perfectly reconstruct electron spectra from depth dose distributions
