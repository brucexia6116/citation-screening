BACKGROUND: Successful radiation was already reported by Genee and Weitzel (1968): Electrons from a Betatron were used for irradiation of the ciliary epithelium to lower aqueous humor secretion. To our knowledge, no other paper on this topic has been published so far. PATIENT: A 26-year-old man had history of concussion trauma and cataract surgery in childhood. In adult age, cataract surgery and retinal operations were followed by numerous surgical procedures and maximal medical treatment because of a secondary glaucoma. The patient refused further surgical and medical treatment with the exception of the administered systemic carbo-anhydrase inhibitor. Because of severe side-effects caused by the acetozolamide, irradiation of the ciliary processes with electrons, emitted from a linear accelerator, was performed. The total amount of 12 Gy both on the nasal and on the temporal side of the ciliary body was fractionated in several sessions. RESULTS: During a follow-up of 22 months without medication, the mean value of i.o. pressure was 22.1 mm Hg. The patient is doing well, corrected VA is 0.8. CONCLUSION: Irradiation of the ciliary processes with electrons for lowering aqueous humor secretion was effective in an otherwise non treatable case of glaucoma
