PURPOSE: Differences in tumor response and intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity make the selection of patients for specific radiation modalities very difficult. The reasons for these differences are still unclear, but are thought to be due to genomic and cellular characteristics. Because radiosensitivities vary between cell cycle stages and because S phase cells are very radioresistant, cell cycle kinetic parameters could be a candidate for predicting intrinsic radiosensitivity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A panel of 15 tumor cell lines was analyzed for S phase content and potential doubling times (Tpot), and the influence of these parameters on the intrinsic radiosensitivity to 60Co gamma- and p(66)/Be neutron irradiation was assessed. RESULTS: S phase content and Tpot show a statistically significant correlation with the mean inactivation dose for photons. The correlation between cell kinetic parameters and the mean inactivation dose for neutrons showed the same trend as photon sensitivity but this was not found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: S phase content and Tpot were identified as suitable criteria for predicting photon sensitivity. It is suggested that cell kinetic parameters could play a role in identifying neutron sensitive tumors if both tumor and normal cells are analyzed
