A retrospective study of 29 patients with invasive carcinoma of the vagina was completed at The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State University, for a ten-year period from 1976-1986. The overall incidence was 1.3% of all gynecologic malignancies. Twenty-four patients (83%) had squamous cell carcinoma and five (17%) had adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma was most commonly located in the upper anterior and lateral vaginal vaults, whereas adenocarcinoma was found more often in the lower anterior and lateral vaginal vaults. The majority of the patients (96%) were managed by a combination of whole-pelvis irradiation and brachytherapy. Twenty-four percent of the patients had a recurrence in the vagina only, indicating the need for better local control. The overall survival rate was 48%. Patients with previous hysterectomy were more likely to develop serious treatment-related complications
