Objective To observe the cell inactivating effects of Li, C and F ions. Method: Li(Z = 3), C(Z = 6) and F(Z = 9) ion beams, with LETs of 100 keV/micron, 300 keV/micron and 1000 keV/micron, respectively were produced by HI-13 tandem accelerator at the Department of Nuclear Physics, China Institute of Atomic Energy. The human bronchial epithelium cell line (BEAS-2B) was irradiated with the designed doses ranging from 0.5 Gy to 6.0 Gy. After irradiation, the cells were cultured at 1000/flask and the survival fractions were calculated. Result: The cell survival fraction (SF, non-unit) have negative exponential relations with dose(D, Gy) as shown by the fitted equations: SF = EXP(-D/1.28)(Li); SF = EXP(-D/1.18)(C); SF = EXP(-D/2.09)(F), respectively. The sensitive parameters (D0, Gy) of radiation were D0 = 1.28; D0 = 1.18; D0 = 2.09, respectively. The patterns of cell survival were fitted to single target model. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for Li, C and F ions were 2.54, 2.67, 1.55, respectively, compared with D0 of gamma-ray irradiation. The inactivation cross sections for these ions were 12.5, 40.6 and 76.5 microns2 respectively. Conclusion: The effectiveness of radiation induced by heavy ions of Li, C and F was more serious than that of 60Co gamma-ray, and more than one particle traversal are needed to kill a cell on the average
