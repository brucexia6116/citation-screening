Proton-beam radiation therapy has been developed for the treatment of chordomas or sarcomas of bone or soft tissue that abut the central nervous system. The authors report the results of treatment of 10 patients, six with chordoma, three with chondrosarcoma, and one with a neurofibrosarcoma. Local control has been achieved for all patients (with, however, one marginal failure) with a follow-up period ranging from 2 months to 6 years. High doses of radiation, up to 76 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE), have been delivered without significant morbidity. In particular, no neurological sequelae have been observed
