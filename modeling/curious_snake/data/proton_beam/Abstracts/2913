Prognostic indicators for the development of metastasis following proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas were evaluated for 510 patients treated from 1975 to 1984. Thirty-three patients developed metastasis (6.5%) from 3 to 51 months following treatment. The primary site of metastasis was the liver in 28 cases (85%). Both demographic and clinical factors were considered. The three leading predictors of survival without metastasis after proton beam irradiation in order of importance were: (1) largest diameter of the tumor; (2) location of the anterior margin of the tumor; and (3) age at treatment. Worse prognosis was associated with largest tumor diameter greater than 15.0 mm, tumor involvement of the ciliary body and age at treatment older than 59 years
