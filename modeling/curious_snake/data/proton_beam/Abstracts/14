PURPOSE: To report a case of ciliary body melanoma that masqueraded as chronic uveitis. METHODS: A patient experienced persistent unilateral panuveitis and elevated intraocular pressure. Inflammation and pressure worsened after cataract extraction and lens implantation. Diagnostic vitrectomy was non-revealing. RESULTS: Repeat vitrectomy and lens implant removal revealed a ciliary body mass, suggestive of melanoma. Ultrasonography and clinical evaluation by the retinal oncologists supported this diagnosis. The uveitis persisted despite aggressive medical treatments, including methotrexate. Proton beam irradiation of the melanoma led to resolution of uveitis and restoration of normal intraocular pressure. CONCLUSION: Ciliary body melanoma can present as chronic uveitis and refractory glaucoma
