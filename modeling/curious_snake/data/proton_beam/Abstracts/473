In order to study the radiobiological effects from low dose radiation, a cell irradiation system using synchrotron X-ray microbeam has been developed, by which cells can be recognised individually and irradiated one by one with the desired dose of monochromatic X rays. The minimum beam sizes obtained are 2 microm with the focusing optics and 5 microm square with the non-focused beam, and the beam size can be changed easily with a high-precision slit in the case of a non-focused beam. Human fibroblast cells were individually irradiated with this system, and immunostained by gamma-H2AX antibody to visualise the DNA damage. Most of the fluorescent foci were observed in a localised area in cell nuclei, the size of which was almost the same as the beam size
