The aim of this work is to present microdosimetric characteristics of 400 MeV amu(-1) and 500 MeV amu(-1) carbon ions obtained by theoretical calculations and to analyse them with respect to experimental data obtained by tissue-equivalent proportional counter in a scope of project ICCHIBAN and by etched track detector CR 39 Page irradiated by LHE nuclotron at JINR, Dubna, Russia. Track structures provided by Monte Carlo code TRIOL are used as an input data for calculations of energy distributions. The calculations of frequency f(y) and dose d(y) distributions are performed using own developed programs
