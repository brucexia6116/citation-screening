OBJECT: The authors analyze their experience with the treatment of 29 patients who underwent radical excision of skull base chordomas. METHODS: Modern skull base surgical techniques were used in all patients who were treated between August 1991 and July 2000. The degree of tumor resection was gauged according to intraoperative inspection and postoperative high-resolution imaging findings. There were 21 patients with primary disease and eight with recurrent disease. Total resection was accomplished in 18 patients. Five patients had undergone radiotherapy prior to the present surgery, and an additional eight patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy. There were no surgery-related deaths. In five patients who died of the disease, surgery and radiotherapy had failed to effect a cure. Two of the remaining patients are alive with recurrent disease, and there is questionable evidence of recurrence in another patient. All 24 patients are functioning independently. Cranial nerve impairment was the most common postoperative deficit, followed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and infection. CONCLUSIONS: The use of skull base techniques in radical surgery provides an opportunity to excise the tumor and the involved bone. In most cases the procedure-related cranial nerve deficits improve over time. The complications of CSF leakage and infection can be minimized and are preventable. Proton beam irradiation is an excellent adjuvant treatment but is reserved for patients with definite tumor recurrence or residual tumor that can be identified on the imaging studies
