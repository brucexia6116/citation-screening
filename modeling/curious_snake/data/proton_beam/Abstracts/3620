A proton beam with the energy of 100-130 Mev, the range up to 40-100 mm and diameter up to 6 cm was used for radiation therapy of breast cancer metastases to the bones adjoining the vital organs or normal tissues with low tolerance (the skull, sternum, ribs, jaw, etc.). Medium fractionation regimens were used for the single doses of 4-10 Gy. The number of fractions was from 1 to 7, the summary dose 17-28 Gy that corresponded to 35-46 Gy of classic fractionation designed by the TDF factor. The first experience of the irradiation of bone metastases has shown that general and local reactions to proton irradiation correspond to a dose delivered and irradiation regimen and do not differ from those in conventional radiation. A marked therapeutic effect was obtained in all the patients. The formation of bigger diameter proton beams and of a deeper range is required for the irradiation of large zones of bone metastases
