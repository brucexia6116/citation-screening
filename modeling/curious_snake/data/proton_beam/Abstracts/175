PURPOSE: To investigate the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of accelerated nitrogen ions (32-45 MeV/u) compared with 137Cs gamma-rays for the induction of apoptosis in G0 lymphocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human peripheral G0 lymphocytes were exposed in vitro to doses up to 3 Gy. RBE for the induction of apoptosis was studied at different times after irradiation (0, 24, 48 and 72 h) with the use of three different methods: (1) morphological characterization of apoptotic cells after fluorescence staining; (2) cell size distribution analysis of the cell population to detect apoptotic bodies; and (3) electrophoretic analysis of DNA to detect 'DNA-ladders'. RESULTS: RBE values in the range of 1.3-3.0 were obtained from the linear components of the dose response curves. The variation in RBE was primarily dependent on post-irradiation time, where the highest RBE values were obtained after 48 h. The three different techniques used for analysis of apoptosis gave similar results. The significantly increased RBE was also seen as an earlier appearance of DNA-ladders, as well as a more rapid disappearance of the total number of viable cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that nitrogen ions of high linear energy transfer (LET) produce RBE > 1.0 and induce a faster apoptotic response as compared with gamma-photons of low-LET radiation
