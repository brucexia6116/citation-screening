Forty patients with advanced, unresectable squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck were entered on a prospective, randomized study comparing fast neutron radiation therapy with conventional photon radiation therapy. Twenty-six patients were randomized to neutrons, and 14 patients were randomized to photons. The randomization was purposefully unbalanced in favor of the experimental treatment. The complete response rate for the neutron-treated group of patients was 52%. The complete response rate for the photon-treated group of patients was 17%. The difference is statistically significant at the p = .04 level. The two-year survival rates for the neutron-treated group and the photon-treated group were 25 and 0%, respectively. The major complication rates were not statistically significantly different for the two groups (18% for neutrons, and 33% for photons)
