The effects of extended source-to-surface distance (SSD) on the electron beam dose profiles were evaluated for various electron beam energies--6, 9, 12, 15 and 20 MeV-and the accuracy of various output correction methods was analysed on a Mitsubishi linear accelerator using a radiation field analyser (RFA). The dose fall-off region of the central axis depth-dose curves was nearly independent for SSDs up to 120 cm where as in the build-up region, a marginal reduction of surface dose was observed, particularly for lower energies and for smaller field sizes. Effective SSDs and virtual source distances were evaluated for field sizes ranging from 5 x 5 to 15 x 15 cm2 for various energies. Curve fitting was done with the measured outputs with various equations and coefficients were evaluated. The accuracy of the derived output correction factors by effective SSD, virtual source distance and curve-fit methods was assessed by evaluating correlation coefficients between the calculated and the measured values. The correlation coefficient was best with the linear-quadratic equation followed by the effective SSD method and the virtual source method. The output correction based on the linear-quadratic equation showed the best estimate of electron beam output at extended SSDs with an accuracy well within +/- 1%. The rapid reduction of dose due to the applicator-scattered component at d(max) point with an extended SSD was significant for the 5 x 5 cm2 applicator and lower energies
