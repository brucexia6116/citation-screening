SRT is a high-precision technique of radiotherapy which delivers focused irradiation to small target volumes. In the context of external beam radiotherapy it can be described as stereotactically guided conformal radiotherapy. As the technique originated from neurosurgical technology, it has initially been limited to single fraction treatment. However, with the use of relocatable fixation devices the way ahead particularly in its application in the treatment of brain tumours is in fractionated SRT. Currently, single fraction SRT/radiosurgery is of proven value only in the treatment of small inoperable arteriovenous malformations. It is being exploited in the management of brain tumours but so far remains as experimental treatment. We have demonstrated that fractionated SRT in patients with gliomas is a non-invasive equivalent to brachytherapy and in patients with solitary metastases a non-invasive alternative to surgical excision. However, the treatment is not without side effects, and the long-term effectiveness and toxicity of SRT, particularly with the use of unconventional fractionation, is not defined. The future use of SRT in the treatment of brain tumours should not be guided simply by the technical possibilities but by a rational appraisal of all treatment options to achieve the best disease control, survival and toxicity. Although there is potential for benefit in a number of small tumours, SRT cannot at present be recommended as the primary treatment in any tumour. In addition, its use should be discouraged in the treatment of unbiopsied brain lesions and as the major form of treatment of pineal germinomas. The technology of stereotactic radiotherapy is evolving, and it is likely that SRT will be integrated into conventional radiotherapy practice to become simply a high-precision technique of radiotherapy delivery in everyday use.
