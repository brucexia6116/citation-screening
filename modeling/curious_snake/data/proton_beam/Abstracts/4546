The paper discusses the results of treatment of 128 patients with head and neck cancer in whom fast neutrons (Y-120; approximately 6.2 MeV) were used as a single procedure or in combination with surgery. Tumors of different histomorphologic structure displayed unequal sensitivity to fast neutrons. Mean disease-free survival in patients with complete regression of tumor was 24 months following neutron therapy alone, 18.5 months after combined neutron-photon treatment and 5.5 months only in controls. Relapse rates were 20 and 15% in patients with pre- and postoperative neutron treatment, respectively, as compared to 52% in controls
