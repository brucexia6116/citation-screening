PURPOSE OF REVIEW: New developments in the nasal and paranasal sinus cancers are reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to woodworking, several risk factors for nasal and paranasal sinus cancers have been identified, most notably smoking. Progress in the differential diagnosis of small round cell nasal and paranasal sinus cancers allows the precise diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma. Despite recent improvements, T staging for ethmoid and nasal cavity needs refinement. An association of surgery and radiation therapy remains the best treatment modality. Major developments include endoscopic resection of nasal and paranasal sinus cancers, high-precision radiotherapy techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and proton-beam radiotherapy. There is probably no role for chemotherapy in esthesioneuroblastoma. Although chemotherapy is important for aggressive neoplasms, its generalized use for nasal and paranasal sinus cancers awaits the application/development of newer drugs. These drugs might be applied locally since the majority of recurrences remain local. SUMMARY: Progress in the treatment of nasal and paranasal sinus cancers could be achieved through better prevention and the developments of more selective treatments such as endoscopic resection, high-precision radiotherapy, and new chemotherapy drugs.
