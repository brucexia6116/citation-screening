Our present radiobiological knowledge gives rise to the hope of an amelioration of the local results in radiation therapy by means of new categories of radiations. Neutrons are clinically used to a larger extent already, protons occasionally. The physical characteristics of pi-meson beams are especially favorable. Even considerable ameliorations, however, of the percentage of local healing would increase the survival rate by some few per-cent only
