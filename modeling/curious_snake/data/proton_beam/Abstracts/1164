Carbon ion beams have superior dose distribution allowing selective irradiation to the tumor while minimizing irradiation to the surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, carbon ions produce an increased density of local energy deposition with high-energy transfer (LET) components, resulting in radiobiological advantages. Stimulated by the favorable results in fast neutrons, helium ions, and neon ions, a clinical trial of carbon ion therapy was begun at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in 1994. Carbon ions were generated by a medically dedicated accelerator (HIMAC, Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, Japan), which was the world's first heavy ion accelerator complex dedicated to medical use in a hospital environment. In general, patients were selected for treatment when their tumors could not be expected to respond favorably to conventional forms of therapy. A total of 1601 patients were registered in this clinical trial so far. The normal tissue reactions were acceptable, and there were no carbon related deaths. Carbon ion radiotherapy seemed to be a clinically feasible curative treatment modality, and appears to offer improved results not only over conventional X-rays but also even over surgery in some selected carcinomas.
