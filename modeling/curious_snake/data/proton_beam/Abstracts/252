OBJECTS: To show the clinical results of a corpus callosotomy (CC) treatment using conformal stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on a patient with medically intractable multifocal epilepsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 17-year-old male patient underwent corpus callosotomy conformal SRS using a dedicated linear accelerator (linac) with dynamic arcs technique. The prescribed dose was 36.0 Gy at the periphery of the rostrum, genu, and a half of the body of the corpus callosum (CCA). At 8 months after conformal SRS, the patient developed a significant brain edema and moderate transitory motor deficit, which were controlled with steroids. After 32 months follow-up, there is an improvement of 84% on drop attacks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Conformal SRS for corpus callosotomy with a single isocenter reproduce the results reported on literature using Gamma Knife-based SRS. The results show that this technique is safe and demonstrate its efficacy to control seizures
