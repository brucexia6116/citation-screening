PURPOSE: Therapeutic retrospective results obtained after Argon laser photocoagulation of 17 circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas were analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventeen circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas associated with serous retinal detachment were analyzed. All patients were symptomatic but one. Duration of visual symptoms varied from 2 weeks to 3 years. Mean tumor thickness was 3,3mm (1 to 6,5mm). Mean tumor diameter was 6,5mm (2.5 to 15mm). Tumors were juxtapapillary in 9 cases (57%). The mean distance from the fovea was 1,5mm (0 to 3mm), and the fovea was pathological in all cases but two. The tumoral surface was covered by Argon laser spots with the central avascular area spared in the case of subfoveal hemangioma. In the case of subretinal fluid persistence 3 months later, 1 or more photocoagulation sessions were carried out. Follow-up was 27 months (6 to 156 months). RESULTS: Success (complete subretinal fluid resolution) was obtained in 82.4% with 1 or 2 laser photocoagulation sessions. Recurrence was observed in 4 cases (23.5%) but treated with success. Final visual acuity, related to the initial foveal condition, was >=0.5 in 23.5% of cases, and >=0.1 in 70.6% of cases. DISCUSSION: Anatomical and functional results were satisfactory considering initial foveal conditions. Irradiation (external beam irradiation, proton beam therapy, brachytherapy) has been used with success for several years. However, radiation-induced damage was described in addition to a few practical disadvantages. CONCLUSION: Argon laser photocoagulation was an effective noninvasive therapy for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. It remains for us the reference method for treating this tumor
