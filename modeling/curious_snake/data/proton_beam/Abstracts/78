PURPOSE: A new technique is presented for in vivo measurements of the dose equivalent from photoneutrons produced by high-energy radiotherapy accelerators. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The dosimeters used for this purpose are vials of superheated halocarbon droplets suspended in a tissue-equivalent gel. Neutron interactions nucleate the formation of bubbles, which can be recorded through the volume of gel they displace from the detector vials into graduated pipettes. These detectors offer inherent photon discrimination, dose-equivalent response to neutrons, passive operation, and small sensitive size. An in vivo vaginal probe was fabricated containing one of these neutron detector vials and a photon-sensitive diode. Measurements were carried out in patients undergoing high-energy x-ray radiotherapy and were also repeated in-phantom, under similar irradiation geometries. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Neutron doses of 0.02 Sv were measured in correspondence to the cervix, 50 cm from the photon beam axis, following a complete treatment course of 46.5 Gy with an upper mantle field of 18-MV x-rays. This fraction of dose from neutrons is measured reliably within an intense photon background, making the technique a valid solution to challenging dosimetry problems such as the determination of fetal exposure in radiotherapy. These measurements can be easily carried out with tissue-equivalent phantoms, as our results indicate an excellent correlation between in vivo and in-phantom dosimetry
