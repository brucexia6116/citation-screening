The basic radiobiological rationale for the use of fast neutron radiotherapy in the treatment of classically radioresistant tumors such as soft tissue sarcomas, osteogenic sarcomas, and chondrosarcomas is reviewed. There are no definitive randomized studies comparing high and low linear energy transfer radiotherapy for these tumor systems, but a review of published series is highly suggestive of a therapeutic advantage for fast neutrons. For soft tissue sarcomas, the local control rate is 53% (158 of 297) with fast neutrons, compared with 38% (49 of 128) with photons/electrons; for osteogenic sarcomas, the local control rate is 55% (40 of 73) with fast neutrons, compared with 21% (15 of 73) with photons/electrons; and for chondrosarcomas, the local control rate is 49% (25 of 51) with fast neutrons, compared with 33% (10 of 30) with photons/electrons. An ongoing clinical trial for these tumors is also described. [References: 33]
