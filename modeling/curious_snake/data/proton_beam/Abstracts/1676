PURPOSE: To study the impact of radiation quality on the spectrum of chromosome exchange aberrations in human lymphocytes using chromosome arm-specific and telomeric probes. The analysis is focused on: (1) incomplete exchanges, (2) interstitial fragments, (3) interarm intrachanges and (4) the complexity of the aberration patterns. The present data after neutron exposure are compared with previously obtained data after X-irradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolated human lymphocytes from three donors were irradiated with 1 MeV fast neutrons (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 Gy). Analysis was performed on first post-irradiation metaphases with arm-specific probes for chromosome 1 in combination with a pan-centromeric probe, or with telomeric and centromeric PNA probes. RESULTS: In comparison with X-rays, exposure to neutrons leads to: (1) similar frequencies of incomplete exchanges or terminal deletions, (2) a significantly higher induction of both inter- and intraarm intrachanges, (3) a higher proportion of complex aberrations, and (4) aberrations with a higher degree of complexity, i.e. derived from more chromosome breaks which interact more frequently in a non-reciprocal fashion. Essentially no dose dependence was found for the yield ratios between the various types of chromosomal aberrations. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the reduced rejoining deficiency of DNA double-strand breaks induced by high-LET radiation, exposure to neutrons does not lead to enhanced levels of unrejoined chromosome breaks that can be observed as incomplete exchanges in cells that have reached mitosis. Proximity effects are more pronounced after densely ionizing radiation than after sparsely ionizing radiation. Clustered damage produced by neutron tracks results in a high proportion of complex aberrations and in non-reciprocal interactions of chromosome breaks. Most of the exchanges occur within one neutron track and little interaction seems to take place between the breaks formed in different tracks
