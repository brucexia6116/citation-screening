Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and benign or low grade, small malignant tumors can be treated by stereotactic radiotherapy in a single fraction. This report describes a technique for stereotactic treatment of small lesions using conventional, fractionated, photon beam irradiation. The Laitinen's stereoadapter, non-invasive head frame was used. This device was tested for accuracy by serial mountings and found to be accurate within 1 mm. The accuracy of the dose delivered was within 2%. Adaptation of this device to the linear accelerator required the design of secondary circular collimators which decreased the penumbra from 3-4 mm to 2-3 mm. The dose fall off outside the target volume is steep enough when using two non-coplanar arcs (90 to 10% within 1 cm). Thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) in a humanoid phantom showed good correlation with the calculated dose. This system permits delivery of fractionated radiation therapy to small volumes, easily and accurately, under stereotactic conditions
