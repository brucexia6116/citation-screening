The incidence of metastasis and prognostic factors for metastasis in 780 consecutive patients with uveal melanomas treated with proton beam irradiation were evaluated. Metastasis developed in 64 patients (8%). The median time from treatment to the diagnosis of metastasis was 2.1 years (range, 3 months to 7.3 years). The liver was primarily involved in 58 (90%) patients. The 5-year cumulative probability of metastasis developing was 20%. Prognostic factors for metastasis developing were quite comparable to those found for patients treated by enucleation and included largest tumor diameter, involvement of the ciliary body, older age, and extrascleral extension. Surgical localization, tumor height, and elevated liver enzymes before treatment were not important factors in the development of metastasis
