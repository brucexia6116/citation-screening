The DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by X ray and carbon ion beam irradiation in scid cells were analysed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Scid cells and hybrid cells were ideal to study the DNA DSB repair mechanisms, because their genetic backgrounds were identical except DNA-PK activity. Induction of DNA DSBs was determined after exposure to X rays and carbon beams. DNA DSB repair was by biphasic kinetics with a fast and a slow component. For scid cells only a slow component was observed, whereas the kinetics of DSBs repair was biphasic with a fast and a slow component. It was concluded from the experimental data that the induced DSB rejoining in scid cells was due to the lack of DNA-PK activity
