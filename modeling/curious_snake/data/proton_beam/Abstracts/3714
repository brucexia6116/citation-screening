Dosimetry data were obtained on the first dedicated linear accelerator of its type designed for electron intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) within an operating room. The linear accelerator uses a high dose rate, 9 Gy.min-1, to reduce the treatment time. Its chrome-plated brass treatment cones, designed with straight ends and 22.5 degrees beveled ends, are not mechanically attached to the collimator head, but are aligned using a laser projection system. Dosimetry measurements were made for each combination of energy (6, 9, 12, 15, and 16 MeV), cone size (diameters range from 5 to 12 cm), and cone type (22.5 degrees beveled or straight). From these data, depth-dose curves, cone output, and air-gap correction factors were generated that allow the calculation of the monitor setting for delivering a prescribed dose at any depth for any irradiation condition (energy, cone, air gap). Isodose data were measured for every cone using film in a solid water phantom. Scatter off the inside wall of the cone resulted in peripheral dose horns near the surface that were energy and cone dependent, being as large as 120%
