The classical cytogenetic assay to estimate the dose to which an individual has been exposed relies on the measurement of chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes at the first post-irradiation mitosis 48 h after in vitro stimulation. However, evidence is accumulating that this protocol results in an underestimation of the cytogenetic effects of high LET radiation due to a selective delay of damaged cells. To address this issue, human lymphocytes were irradiated with C-ions (25-mm extended Bragg peak, LET: 60-85 keV/ micro m) and aberrations were measured in cells reaching the first mitosis after 48, 60, 72 and 84 h and in G2-phase cells collected after 48 h by calyculin A induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC). The results were compared with recently published data on the effects of X-rays and 200 MeV/u Fe-ions (LET: 440 keV/ micro m) on lymphocytes of the same donor (Ritter et al., 2002a). The experiments show clearly that the aberration yield rises in first-generation metaphase (M1) with culture time and that this effect increases with LET. Obviously, severely damaged cells suffer a prolonged arrest in G2. The mitotic delay has a profound effect on the RBE: RBE values estimated from the PCC data were about two times higher than those obtained by conventional metaphase analysis at 48 h. Altogether, these observations argue against the use of single sampling times to quantify high LET induced chromosomal damage in metaphase cells. Copyright 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel
