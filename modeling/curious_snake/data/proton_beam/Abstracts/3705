The somatic dose index was determined for large-field irradiations with the 10 MeV bremsstrahlung of a linear accelerator. Among the possible field shapes, the authors investigated the mantle field, the inverted Y field, the boomerang field, as well as total body irradiation and upper and lower partial body irradiation. The measured data are discussed with respect to clinical aspects
