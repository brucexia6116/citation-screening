A Monte Carlo simulation of the photon dose due to scattered x rays, head leakage photons, and capture gamma rays in the maze of an 18 MeV accelerator facility was carried out. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation were compared with dose measurements made in the maze and also with values calculated using an empirical equation. Agreement within +/-26% was found among the three techniques used to evaluate the capture gamma ray dose. It was found that the empirical equation overestimated the scattered x ray plus head leakage photon dose by a factor as large as 2.9 as compared to the other methods. It was concluded that the photon dose, for mazes greater than 3 m in length, is produced predominately by capture gamma rays
