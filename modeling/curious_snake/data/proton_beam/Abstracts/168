A series of tests were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of a diode detector array in measuring flatness and symmetry of x-ray and electron energies, and the ability to determine change in beam energy. The results show the diode detector array accurately measures flatness and symmetry and can accurately measure or detect change in beam energy. The evaluation also demonstrates the utility of using this model detector system in a linear accelerator QC program
