PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) for vestibular schwannomas in patients treated at two university-affiliated hospitals. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-nine patients were treated between April 1996 and September 2000. The median age was 56 years (range: 29-80), and median maximal tumor diameter was 20 mm (range: 9-40). A total of 11 patients had fifth and/or seventh cranial nerve dysfunction before irradiation; 2 patients had only facial weakness, 5 patients had only facial numbness, and 4 patients had both facial weakness and numbness. Thirty-three patients were treated with primary FSRT, and 6 patients were treated for recurrent or persistent disease after previous surgery. All patients were treated with 6-MV photons using a stereotactic system with a relocatable frame. The 39 patients received 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. Median follow-up was 21.8 months (range: 4.4-49.6). RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 37 patients (95%). Two patients experienced deterioration of their symptoms at 3 and 20 months as a result of clinical progression in one case and tumor progression in the other and underwent surgery post FSRT. A total of 19/28 (67.9%) patients preserved serviceable hearing after FSRT. Deterioration of the facial and trigeminal nerves was observed in only 2 patients who were treated with surgery post FSRT. CONCLUSION: FSRT provided excellent tumor control with minimal morbidity and good hearing preservation in this cohort of patients. Longer follow-up is required to confirm long-term control rates
