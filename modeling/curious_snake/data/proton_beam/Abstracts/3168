Megavoltage x-ray beams generated by linear accelerators (linacs) deliver their maximum dose a few centimetres below the treatment or phantom surface. This skin-sparing effect is degraded by the generation of secondary electrons as the x-ray beam passes to the patient or phantom. This work measures the characteristics of these electrons. A light-weight electromagnet was constructed that could be mounted in the block-tray position, 58 cm from the x-ray source of a Varian Clinac 2100C or 2500 linac. A field strength as high as 0.1500 T was generated, which was strong enough to sweep secondary electrons out of a 10 cm x 10 cm field. For 6, 10 and 24 MV x-ray beams, secondary contamination electrons produced 18, 38 and 65% of the surface dose, corresponding to 3, 5 and 12% of the maximum dose, respectively. A parameterized depth-dose curve for the contamination electrons was produced and was valid for all the x-ray energies studied
