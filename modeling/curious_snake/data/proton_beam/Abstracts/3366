Whether for diagnosis or therapeutic purposes, X-rays have many applications in medicine. Synchrotron Radiation sources open new perspectives. This has already been the case for a number of years in molecular and cellular biology where the scope of absorption and diffraction work has been greatly extended. This could also be the case for medical imaging and radiotherapy where the characteristics of the beam (collimation, stability, flux) allow new approaches in the energy range of radiological X-rays, namely between 30 keV and 100 keV. Such a source exists today in Grenoble, with the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The opening of a beamline dedicated to medical research for whole European scientific community is planned for the end of 1996. This beamline, coupled with the "microbeam" beamlines, will cover medical imaging (angiography, tomodensitometry, microtomography, X-ray microscopy) as well as radiotherapy
