The genetic risks associated with manned space flight are judged to be of little significance to the general population. The risks may be significant to the irradiated individual, particularly if one focuses attention on the incidence of dominant and chromosomal mutations that are expressed in the first generation offspring. Even so, the risk is not increased to a great extent by the low linear energy transfer (LET) component of the space radiations. It is the presumed high LET component, neutrons especially, that would make the major contribution to the risk, because the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values for this component, relative to low dose-rate photon irradiation, are between 10 and 40, depending upon the particular genetic effect and dose-rate comparison. The appropriate RBE value would probably be 20 or greater, so that even small neutron doses become magnified in their contribution. Under the assumed condition of protracted exposure to 8 rads of low LET radiation and 2 rads of high LET radiation, or from 48 to 88 rem, the individual's risk of transmitting a new dominant mutation that will be expressed in his immediate offspring is estimated to increase by at least 4% and as much as about 40%. The HZE-particle component is not expected to make a significant contribution to the total risk
