Aluminum tubes, 20 cm long, of various diameter and face angle have been used to collimate electron beams for intraoperative radiotherapy. The tubes placed in a body cavity are clamped to the treatment couch. A thin rod is fixed coaxially to a disc which is placed on the entrance face of the tube. A stepwise procedure involving couch translation, rotation, and gantry rotation is used to align the central axis of the beam with the axis of the cone. Further collimation is provided by an aperture mounted in an assembly which slides into the standard accessory holder of the machine and is separated by a 10 cm air gap from the tube in the patient. Careful adjustment of this aperture diameter results in a relatively uniform dose across the treated area. The use of 3 mm wall thickness aluminum tube provides for minimal leakage outside of the cone. A camera has been mounted to a plate that also mounts in the standard accessory holder and is used to document the area treated
