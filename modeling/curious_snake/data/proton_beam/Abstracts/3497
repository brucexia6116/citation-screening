Electron-microscopic morphometry has been applied to study mitochondria on ultrathin sections of lymphocytes from human peripheral blood. It has been shown that the stimulation of lymphocytes by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) 1 h causes increases in the quantity of mitochondria per cellular section (17%) as well as in the total area of mitochondria per cell section (35%), i.e. an increase in mitochondrial mass. Taking into account known facts about growth and division of mitochondria in late phases of cellular cycle, one can suppose that described above changes in mitochondria during G0----G1 transition under action of PHA belong to an early phase of biogenesis of mitochondria. In the contrary, irradiation of lymphocytes with He-Ne-laser (lambda = 632.8 nm) in dose 56 J/m2 which does not cause the G0----C1 transition, results in the increase in the number of mitochondria per cellular section (20%) but not increase in the total area of mitochondria per cell section. The last finding indicates to some modification of space configuration of the mitochondria without any changes in their mass. The increase in the quantity of mitochondria per cellular section after the irradiation could be related with the increase in electrochemical proton gradient and in phosphorylating activity of mitochondria. He-Ne-laser radiation as well as mitogen PHA cause some deaggregation of mitochondria (this is more pronounced in case of PHA) which may be related to their functional activation
