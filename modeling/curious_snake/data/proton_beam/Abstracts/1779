A 52-year-old-male patient was treated for a posterior choroid melanoma of the right eye. When it was diagnosed, it measured 6mm in thickness and 11.9mm for the largest diameter and had a typical mushroom shape. General investigations found no metastatic disease. It was treated with proton-beam irradiation. Seven years later, the patient experienced increased intraocular pressure associated with cataract and pain. The patient finally accepted enucleation, as the vision of this eye was completely lost and the eye had become painful. Histologic analysis of the eye showed changes affecting both the anterior and the posterior segments of the eye, mostly related to the tumor and the consequences of treatment. Neovascular glaucoma is a major complication that very often leads to enucleation
