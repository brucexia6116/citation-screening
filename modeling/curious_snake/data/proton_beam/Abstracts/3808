Primitive ocular melanoma is a rare tumor in adults. Although this tumor is radio-resistant and located in a very radiosensitive organ, a conservative approach using radiotherapy is feasible for small or medium size melanomas. The physical and radiobiological basis of the techniques presently used, brachytherapy and protontherapy, are presented together with the complications inherent to each treatment. Future prospects discussed concern the association of hyperthermia with conventional irradiation and Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). The relevance of each technique with reference to the size and location of the tumor is discussed. [References: 196]
