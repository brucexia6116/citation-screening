Dosimetry measurements at nominal electron energies of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, and 22 MeV were made for different sized, open-sided applicators on two Philips SL25 linear accelerators. Measurements include beam flatness, percentage depth dose, surface dose, isodose curves, field size dependence, output at extended distances, virtual source position, and required low melting point alloy thickness for field shaping. These measurements are presented to document the characteristics of electron beams with a new type of applicator design on this series of Philips accelerators
