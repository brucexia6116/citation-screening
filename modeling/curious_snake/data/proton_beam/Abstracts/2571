Since 1969 proton beam therapy of patients with different types of diseases using the ITEP synchrotron proton beam with the energy up to 200 MeV has been conducted in a number of Moscow medical centers. These irradiations employing a specially formed beam are used on a routine basis and are performed in parallel with the program of physical research. Two additional channels as well as two new procedure rooms have been in operation since 1982. A special setup of equipment including clinical dosimetry devices, equipment for patients' irradiation (4 special units), and computer-controlled systems have been installed at the facility. By the present time over 1300 patients have been irradiated. The authors describe physical and dosimetric equipment and irradiation techniques. A summary table containing data on the patients is provided
