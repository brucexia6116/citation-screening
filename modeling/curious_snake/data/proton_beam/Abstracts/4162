In this article an analytical equation for electron depth dose is proposed electron energies from 6-20 MeV. The equation contains four parameters and it fits the build-up region, fall-off region as well as the bremsstrahlung background region. The calculated values from this equation fit within 1,5% of the measured data in the build-up region and in the fall-off region within 0,5 mm for the energy range 5-10 MeV and within 1 mm for the range 12-20 MeV. This equation can be applied beyond the practical range
