Shaping-up of a dose field in a stretch by means of dot-type and linear irradiation sources is mathematically interpreted. A criterion of an optimal dose field is formulated for the contact radiotherapy applicable to malignant tumors, which is based on homogeneity of such therapy. The task of forming an optimal dose field in a stretch by the dot-type and linear irradiation sources is insoluble on the basis of analytical methods. The task properties were investigated and an iterative method designed to solve it was elaborated on the basis of such properties
