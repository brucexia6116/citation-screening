The double-differential cross-sections for the 12C(n, px), 12C(n, dx), 12C(n, tx) and 12C(n, alpha x) reactions have been measured at three incident neutron energies, 42.5, 62.7 and 72.8 MeV, at laboratory angles between 20 degrees and 160 degrees. From these measurements, the energy-differential cross-sections have been determined and consequently the partial and total kerma values. Results of the experimental double-differential and energy-differential cross-sections at the three incident neutron energies are presented. The deduced kerma values are compared with previous measurements and theoretical predictions
