EBT radiochromic films were used to determine skin-dose maps for patients undergone Total Skin Electron Therapy (TSET). Gafchromic EBT radiochromic film is one of the newest radiation-induced auto-developing photon and electron-beam analysis films available for therapeutic radiation dosimetry in radiotherapy applications. EBT films can be particularly useful in TSET; due to patient morphology, underdosed regions typically occur, and the radiochromic film represents a suitable candidate for monitoring them. In this study, TSET was applied to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The technique for TSET was implemented by using an electron beam with a nominal energy of 6MeV. The patient was treated in a standing position using dual angled fields in order to obtain the greatest dose uniformity along the patient's longitudinal axis. The electron beam energy was degraded by a PMMA filter. The in vivo dose distribution was determined through the use of EBT films, as well as of thermoluminescent dosimeters for comparison (TLDs). EBT results showed a reasonable agreement with TLDs data
