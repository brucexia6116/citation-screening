Conservative treatment was carried out in 119 cases of hepatic malignancy (primary cancer--36 and metastatic tumors--83). Radiation therapy using a Rokus-M installation or a Saturn linear accelerator was performed in 26 cases, chemoradiation treatment--14 and cytostatic therapy alone--in 79 patients. Single focal dose used was 2 Gy, while total dose was as high as 51-70 Gy in cases receiving radiation alone and 35-40 Gy in the combined therapy group. Various combinations of carminomycin, bleomycin, cisplatinum, adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil, allopurinol and cyclophosphamide were employed. Radiation and chemoradiation treatment proved effective in 67.5% of cases. Mean survival time for patients suffering primary cancer was 15.8 +/- 4.3 months, and for those with metastatic tumor--8.3 +/- 1.6 months. Remission was registered in 14, while stabilization--in 31 out of 79 patients who had received chemotherapy. The symptomatic effect was observed in 38%
