The excellent palliative value of halfbody radiation is well documented. The optimum time to use this modality for palliation of symptoms is unclear. Our department treated 44 evaluable patients with upper and lower halfbody radiation.

The optimum benefit from halfbody irradiation is derived when administered at the earliest indicated time
