Updated information is given on alpha-particle-induced cancer in persons internally exposed to 222Rn progeny, Thorotrast, long-lived 226Ra and 228Ra, and short-lived 224Ra. The lung cancer risk to persons breathing 222Rn progeny in the indoor air of offices, schools, and homes is of increasing concern. About half of the recent deaths among the German Thorotrast patients have been from liver cancer. Animal studies indicate that the liver cancer risk from Thorotrast is mainly from its radioactivity and that the risk coefficient for the Thorotrast patients can be used provisionally for other alpha emitters in the human liver. Six skeletal cancers have occurred in persons with average skeletal doses between 0.85 and 11.8 Gy from 226Ra and 228Ra. In the low-dose German 224Ra patients, two skeletal sarcomas have occurred at about 0.7 Gy compared to about six cases predicted by results from 224Ra patients at higher doses. The minimal appearance time for radiation-induced bone sarcomas in humans is about 4 y. Following brief irradiation, the vast majority of induced bone sarcomas are expressed by about 30 y. Recent evidence against the "practical threshold" hypothesis is given. With the downward revision of neutron doses to the atomic-bomb survivors, the follow-up of persons exposed to alpha particles may be the best opportunity to evaluate directly the effects of high LET radiation on humans.
