This study is an attempt to compare the dosimetric parameters of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using patient data. Radiosurgery was delivered through circular tertiary collimators attached to a linear accelerator. Six patients who were treated with SRS were replanned and evaluated with the IMRT planning system. Contouring of all structures, including target volume, was done on the IMRT system to closely match the SRS system. Treatment plans were generated after specifying the goals in the prescription module. The NOMOS BEAK collimator attached to the NOMOS MIMiC delivery device was chosen for treatment delivery. Various parameters such as conformity index, homogeneity index, target volume coverage, nontarget tissue, and brainstem doses were calculated and compared between the IMRT and SRS systems. Patient data were divided into 2 groups based on the complexity of the lesion and the number of isocenters used for radiosurgery. Analysis was done for each group and for the cumulative data. Superior conformality and homogeneous dose distribution in IMRT for multiple isocenter cases were observed. In addition, critical structure volumes for 50%, 70%, and 90% of the prescribed dose were lower in IMRT compared to SRS treatment. However, nontarget tissue received significantly higher doses with IMRT plans. Results show that IMRT treatment modality produces similar results as radiosurgery for small, spherical lesions, whereas it is found to be superior to SRS for irregular lesions in terms of critical structure sparing and better dose homogeneity
