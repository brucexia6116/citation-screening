Information concerning the application of proton beams in radiotherapy of ocular tumours is provided using conventional website technology by a number of treatment facilities around the world. We hypothesized, however, that many of the key concepts would be better conveyed by an interactive computer model utilizing virtual reality technology. We describe the implementation, using Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML), of such a model, the Proton Therapy Concepts Demonstrator (PTCD). The World-Wide-Web-accessible PTCD is intended to provide information useful both to trainee and to qualified clinical staff and also to patients. A model was created of the radiotherapy room that was linked to an interactive model depicting a simple explanation of the process of proton eye radiotherapy. This model also allows the user to explore specific elements of the treatment planning and delivery process, such as beam collimation and range modulation. A further level of detail has been provided by a dynamic model demonstrating how a specific modulated dose distribution is achieved as the time integration of discrete modulated Bragg peaks. We believe this VR-based model has the potential of enabling users to gain more rapid insight into the proton therapy process. Its development as an educational tool is continuing, following feedback collected from clinical staff and patients
