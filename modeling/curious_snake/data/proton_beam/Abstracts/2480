A simple and fast empirical model has been developed which accurately predicts central axis surface and build up dose for a 6MV radiotherapy x-ray beam. The model is based on fits to experimental data and accounts for open fields, block trays and wedges at normal incidence and at angle. The model separates the beam into components produced by primary photon interactions which have only interacted in the phantom at normal and oblique incidence and head scattered photons/electrons generated in the treatment head. The model quantifies these components for open unwedged fields and then the effect on each component by introducing beam modifying devices/ accessories or changing the angle of incidence is determined. Dose results at oblique incidence for Monte Carlo (electron contamination free) and experimental (electron contamination present) are sufficiently close to imply that the increase in build up dose with beam angle is mainly due to changes in photon interactions within the phantom and only a slight increase with angle is due to changes in the electron contamination. Electron contamination/ head scatter component was found to be measurable by three methods. These being TLD extrapolation in air, ionisation chamber measurements in air and Monte Carlo pure photon methods. These methods produced comparable electron contamination/head scatter dose results at all field sizes
