The AAPM TG 39 protocol has proposed three different methods of calibrating plane-parallel ionization chambers, i.e., in-phantom irradiation with a high-energy electron beam and in-phantom and in-air 60Co irradiation. To verify the consistency of the three methods, we have measured Ngaspp values using each of these techniques for the five most commonly used plane-parallel chambers considered by the protocol. Our results demonstrate that the measured Ngaspp values for the three different methods for any of the chambers agree to within +/- 0.6%. Once Ngaspp was measured, the determination of absorbed dose for electron beams with different energies for an AECL Therac 20 and Philips SL25 was carried out according to the AAPM TG 39 protocol. The results show that the determination of the absorbed dose outputs for any of the five chambers agree to within +/- 0.7% for electron-beam energies of 4-20 MeV if all five chambers had Ngaspp values determined by the electron-beam method. The uncertainties are well within the expected error for these approaches
