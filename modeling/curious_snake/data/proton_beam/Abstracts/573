In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1HMRS) can substantially improve the non-invasive categorization of human brain tumors, especially for gliomas. It provides greater information concerning tumor activity and characterization of the tumor tissue than is possible with MRI techniques alone. Moreover, 1HMRS may ultimately prove to be a highly beneficial modality in the post-irradiation care of patients with brain gliomas. This paper reviews the current status of 1HMRS with the emphasis on its clinical utility in the diagnosis of active tumor processes of gliomas, and its use in planning surgical and radiation therapy interventions and monitoring tumor treatment paradigms.
