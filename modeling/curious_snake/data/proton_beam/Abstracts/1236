A computer-controlled, alpha-particle irradiator is described that allows for the measurement of the number and location of alpha-particle hits to individual cell nuclei, and subsequent scoring of cell survival. Cells are grown on a track-etch material (LR 115) and images are obtained of the cells prior to irradiation. The cells are then irradiated from below by a planar, collimated Am-241 source. The exposure time is varied so that the average number of hits to cell nuclei ranges from 0 to 3. After cell survival has been scored, images of the etched material are obtained and spatially registered to the original cell images. The etched images and cellular images are superimposed allowing for the determination of the number and position of hits to individual cell nuclei. This paper characterizes the irradiator including the energy and fluence of the incident alpha particles. Additionally, we describe the sources of uncertainty associated with this experiment, including the cell dish repositioning and cell migration during scanning and irradiation
