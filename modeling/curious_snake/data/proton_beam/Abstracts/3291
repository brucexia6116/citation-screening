A dosimetric technique based on proportional counter microdosimetry has been developed for the dosimetry of mixed radiation fields employed in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The technique has been successfully used to measure the gamma, fast neutron and the boron dose rates in the mixed radiation field from a 252Cf source. The measured fast neutron and boron dose rates are in good agreement with the calculations and the measurements reported by other researchers. A systematic discrepancy is observed in the gamma dose rate measurements, with the present measurements being approximately 35% lower than those reported elsewhere
