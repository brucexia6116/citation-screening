A direct comparison was carried out of the biological effectiveness of protons and alpha-particles of the same linear energy transfer (LET) under identical conditions with a variety of in vitro biological systems. Monolayers of mammalian cells were irradiated with accelerated beams of protons (1.2 and 1.4 MeV) and alpha-particles (30 and 35 MeV) corresponding to LETs of 23 and 20 keV microns-1 for each particle type. For V79-4 cells it was observed that the linear term of the dose-response for cell inactivation by protons was significantly greater than that for alpha-particles of the same LET. For HeLa and HeLa S3 cells, also, the linear term appeared to be greater for protons, but this was not observed with more limited data for C3H 10T1/2 cells. The result for V79 cells is in agreement with the report of Belli et al. (1989) who observed that the biological effectiveness of protons rose sharply between 17 and 30 keV microns-1 in strong contrast to alpha-particles which reached a peak effectiveness at greater than 100 keV microns-1. These results place new constraints on the biologically relevant features of the microscopic structure of radiation tracks, and have implications for the mechanistic and practical comparison between radiations
