The authors represent the results of the treatment of 20 children with Itsenko-Cushing disease (ICD) by proton-beam irradiation of the pituitary body. The use of the medical proton beam of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics was found to be effective for the treatment of children with mild and average forms of ICD. Irradiation of the pituitary gland at a dose of 70-100 Gy is accompanied by general and local radiation reactions which are not dangerous for children. The time of development of remission after irradiation depends on a degree of severity and features of a course of disease
