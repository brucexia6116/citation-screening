The dosimetry of small photon beams used for stereotactic radiosurgery was investigated using Monte Carlo simulation, convolution calculations, and measurements. A Monte Carlo code was used to simulate radiation transport through a linear accelerator to produce and score energy spectrum and angular distribution of 6 MV bremsstrahlung photons exiting from the accelerator treatment head. These photons were then transported through a stereotactic collimator system and into a water phantom placed at isocenter. The energy spectrum was also used as input for the convolution method of photon dose calculation. Monte Carlo and convolution results were compared with the measured data obtained using an ionization chamber, a diode, and film
