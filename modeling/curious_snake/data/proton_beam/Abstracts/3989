Various wedge isodose angles or simply wedge angles smaller than the nominal wedge angle were created by combining the isodose distributions generated from a single physical wedge with the isodose distributions of the open field for the 8-MV photon beam. The particular wedge angle generated depends on the weights imposed on these isodose distributions. The relationship between these weights and the wedge angle were examined and found to be nonlinear. The difference between the wedge angles defined at 10 cm depth and those defined using the 50% isodose curve is less 6 degrees. The present data was fitted using two proposed empirical equations
