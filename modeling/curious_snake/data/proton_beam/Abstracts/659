The assessment of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for alpha-radiation was held in the cases of inhalation of radon progeny and incorporation of plutonium in lungs. It is based on simulation of lung cancer radiation risk for different types of radiation. Specific radiation risk models developed according to the results of direct epidemiological studies are used for the simulation. These include two published risk models for uranium miners and nuclear workers of the Mayak facilities in the former Soviet Union. Additionally two lung cancer risk models are developed and described for the following cases: population indoor radon exposure and low-linear-energy-transfer reference radiation exposure. By the results of lifetime lung cancer risk simulation the RBE values range from 11 to 12 and from 1.7 to 4.9 for the cases of plutonium incorporation and of radon progeny exposure accordingly. The significant uncertainty of radiation risk models results in significant variation of RBE assessments. Rough estimations of RBE values 90% confidence interval are from unit fraction to 25 and from 2 to 50 for the cases of radon progeny exposure and plutonium incorporation accordingly
