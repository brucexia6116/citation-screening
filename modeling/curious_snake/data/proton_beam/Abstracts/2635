Thanks to the Bragg vertical and the straight course of protons, the physical selectivity of proton beam is greater then that of megavoltage photons. Since January 1991 we treated 3 retinoblastomas with proton beam at the cyclotron of Louvain-la-Neuve. Results are encouraging. The short term outcome seems comparable to phototherapy, but the long term expectancy is better, because of reduced secondary malignancies. Proton beam treatment for selected retinoblastomas seems a good alternative to external radiotherapy
