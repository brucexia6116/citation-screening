When the collimator setting of a linear accelerator is made sufficiently small, the output factor in air, R, is greatly reduced because the collimators obstruct the periphery of the x-ray source. This has been utilized to examine the size of the source by varying the width y of a narrow field and determining how R(y) varies. The sources diameters in the two principal directions were clearly influenced by the design of the accelerators. The x-ray sources of two accelerators with bending magnets were found to be noncircular while that of a linear accelerator without a magnet showed circular symmetry. The position of the source relative to the axis of collimator rotation was determined by measuring R for offset narrow fields. For one of the accelerators, the source was initially moving and off the central axis by about 2 mm for the first five monitor units. The results correlated well with sharpness in portal-film images. The technique can serve to evaluate the major source characteristics in acceptance testing and quality control
