The aim of radiotherapy treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is to irradiate the skin with an appropriately homogeneous dose distribution up to a few millimetres in depth. This can be achieved by applying one of the total skin electron irradiation techniques. An aluminium/polystyrene foam electron scattering filter was designed so that the incident beam is broadened and degraded sufficiently to achieve a mean dose uniformity in a rectangular field of 180 cm height and 40 cm width. This paper reports on the development and construction of the electron scattering filter for use with a Varian 2100C accelerator, without MLCs, with a dose uniformity, over a useful field dimension of 180 cm height and 40 cm width, of +/- 7% about the mean, and an x-ray contamination of less than 2.4% beyond a depth of 3 cm
