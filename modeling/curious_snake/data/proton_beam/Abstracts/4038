The authors have addressed the physical and technical problems involved in the total skin irradiation with a linear accelerator Varian Clinac 2100 C expressly preset for this modality with electrons of 6 MeV nominal energy and dose rate of about 2500 UM/min at the isocenter. The six dual field technique has been implemented and the effect of interposed degrading filters has been evaluated with film dosimetry on an anthropomorphic phantom. It was verified that the total skin electron irradiation expressly offered by the manufacturer as an established treatment option on the Clinac 2100 C with high performance ionizing chambers and high dose rate makes the all procedure safer and simpler
