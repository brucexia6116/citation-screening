Clinical application of light ion beams requires correct understanding of the complex processes of ion interaction with matter and the development of accurate transport methods. Knowledge of the fluence differential in energy of primary and secondary particles is important since it allows evaluation of different linear energy transfer (LET) dose components in the patient. The low LET and high LET particle distributions and the corresponding absorbed doses due to primary and secondary particles were evaluated for different depths in a water phantom using the Monte Carlo code SHIELD-HIT. SHIELD-HIT calculations are compared with the experimental LET distributions for a carbon beam of energy 278 MeV u(-1) from the HIMAC facility in Japan. The capability of the code for the evaluation of particle transport in thin layers of a few micrometres is demonstrated
