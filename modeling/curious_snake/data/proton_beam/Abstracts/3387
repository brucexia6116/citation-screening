The paper is devoted to the description of methods of topometric preparation of 73 prostatic cancer patients for gamma-and proton-beam irradiation using an x-ray simulator and a CT tomograph. Basing on the measurement of the prostate in 3 directions in patients with different stages of disease (T1-2-24, T3-29 and T4-20), a conclusion was made that a prostate size was not enough to determine a stage of disease though a tendency to an increase in prostate size corresponded to the growing T index. However, stages T1-2 and T4 could be determined for sure within a certain range of prostate size values
