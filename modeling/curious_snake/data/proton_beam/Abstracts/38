PURPOSE: This study reviews the results of patients referred from Ireland for treatment of an intraocular melanoma at the Ocular Oncology Service at St Paul's Eye Unit, Liverpool. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 57 patients with a median age of 55 years. Management included plaque radiotherapy (14), proton beam radiotherapy (17), local resection (10), endoresection (6), and enucleation (10). Fifty-two tumours involved the choroid. The tumours had a mean diameter of 11.4 mm and a mean thickness of 5.2 mm. RESULTS: The follow-up period had a median of 267 days. Retention of the eye was achieved in all 47 cases who underwent conservative management. Ninety percent of patients retained a vision of counting fingers, with an acuity of 6/12 or better in 50%. CONCLUSION: This group of patients gives an indication of the results that can be expected when uveal melanoma is managed by a variety of conservative techniques in a specialised ocular oncology service
