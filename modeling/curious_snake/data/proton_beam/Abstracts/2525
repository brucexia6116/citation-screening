One Varian 2100C medical linear accelerator (LINAC) was installed at Kaohsiung Medical College Hospital last summer. The outputs of this LINAC are 6 and 10 MV X-ray beams, and 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 MeV electron beams. A commissioning procedure including acceptance tests, dose data, environmental radiation survey was executed when the LINAC installation was completed. The acceptance tests organized as a sequential were performed by the medical physicist and Varian's engineers. Dose determination and environmental radiation survey were measured with ion chamber, phantom and survey meters. Radiation dose was calculated following the protocal of the Task Group 21, Radiation Therapy Committee of the American Association of the Physicists in Medicine (AAPM). After the commissioning procedure, the license application to operate the LINAC was submitted to the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) of Executive Yuan. When the license was authorized by the AEC last November, a quality assurance (QA) program was established and performed continuously in order to keep the Varian LINAC with high quality of radiation therapy
