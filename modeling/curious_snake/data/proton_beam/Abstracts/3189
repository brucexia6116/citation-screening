The microwave-powered electron linear accelerator, or linac, is becoming the dominant radiotherapy treatment unit. Several technical advances, combined with attention to how patients are most effectively set up and treated, have led to continuing improvements in linac radiotherapy. This review describes: improvements in accelerator structures, widely variable energy linacs , microtrons , beam transport systems, and treatment head design
