PURPOSE: Retrospective analysis of the treatment of choroidal melanoma with protontherapy at the Centre de protontherapie d'Orsay, France. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1991 and September 1995, 612 patients presenting with choroidal melanoma were treated by protontherapy in Orsay. Following initial management of the first 464 patients, results were analyzed, as were results after a 1-year follow-up for 305 patients, a 2-year follow-up for 169 patients, and a 3-year follow-up for 59 patients. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that the actuarial local recurrence rate was 5%, the 3-year survival rate 88%, and the overall metastasic rate 5%. The initial tumor volume was the most significant predictive factor for visual results and metastases. Multivariate analysis revealed that visual results were significantly related to the initial tumor volume, initial retinal detachment, and total dose delivered to the optic nerve and macula. CONCLUSION: Protontherapy of choroidal melanoma allows in most cases conservation of the eye without modification of survival. Visual results mainly depend on the site and size of the tumor
