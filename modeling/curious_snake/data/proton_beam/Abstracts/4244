The response of a human malignant melanoma cell line in vitro to high linear energy transfer radiation was studied utilizing the neutrons produced by the reaction of 16 and 50 MeV deuterons on beryllium. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) relative to cobalt-60 gamma radiation was determined under conditions of complete oxygenation. The data indicate that the radioresistance ascribed to malignant melanoma in vivo is not an intrinsic quality of the cell but rather may be mediated by the in vivo environment
