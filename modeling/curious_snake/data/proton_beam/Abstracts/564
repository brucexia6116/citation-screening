The MCNPX code has been employed on a personal computer to calculate the dosimetric characteristics of the photon beams from the 6 MV Siemens MX2 and the 10 MV Varian Clinac 2100C linear accelerators. A model of the treatment head includes the major geometric structure within the beam path. The model was used to calculate the energy spectra of the photon beam, percentage depth dose and the dose profiles. The accuracy of the calculated results is examined by comparing them with the measured dose distributions for the two machines. The computed and measured depth dose curves agree to within 2% for all the depths beyond the build-up region for both treatment machines. The calculations agree to within 2% of the measured profiles within the 100-50% dose level. It has been found that the MCNPX code is an effective tool for simulating the clinical photon beam
