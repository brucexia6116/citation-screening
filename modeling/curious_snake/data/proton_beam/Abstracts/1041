PURPOSE: Evaluation of treatment outcome after intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) +/- external-beam irradiation (EBRT) in patients with localized soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity at high risk for local recurrence after limb-sparing surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 28 patients treated between 1989 and 1999 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients presented with locally recurrent (n = 17), T2 (n = 20), high-grade (n = 26), or incompletely resected tumors (n = 11). All patients underwent limbsparing surgery and IORT (median dose of 15 Gy) given either with high-dose-rate brachytherapy or a linear accelerator. 25 patients received additional EBRT with a mean of 50.6 Gy (range: 30.6-60 Gy). The mean follow-up time was 4.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0-5.6 years). RESULTS: The 5-year overall and distant disease-free survival rates were 66% and 54%, respectively. The overall actuarial recurrence rate after 5 years is 16% (95% CI: 1%, 31%). The crude rate after 8 years is 18%. Surgical margin status, primary versus recurrent tumor and tumor stage did not show any statistically significant influence (univariate analysis) on local recurrence rates. Patients with T1 tumors exhibited a borderline significant (p = 0.053) better distant disease-free survival (83%) compared to T2 tumors (43%). Five (24%) grade 3-4 late side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: In patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas, IORT +/- EBRT after limb-preserving surgery achieves high local control rates. The risk of normal tissue toxicities is comparable to conventional limb-sparing treatment
