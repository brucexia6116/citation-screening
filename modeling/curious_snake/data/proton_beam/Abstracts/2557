During our routine calibration of a Varian Clinac-20 linear accelerator, the absorbed dose for a fixed monitor unit (mu) was found to decrease with increasing dose rate. Between dose rates of 100 and 500 mu/min, there was up to 20% difference in absorbed dose for a 20-MeV electron beam. The cause of this problem was a failure in the electronics circuit of an integrating board. This paper presents our analysis of the problem and suggests a possible means of isolating such a failure to warn technologists, physicists, and engineers
