A technique for the determination of treatment parameters that are required to achieve a desired depth dose distribution in electron arc therapy is discussed and a method for calculating isodose distributions is presented. Both the treatment technique and the dose calculation method rely on the angle beta concept, which uniquely describes the dependence of the radial percentage depth doses in electron arc therapy on the nominal field width, isocenter depth, and virtual source-axis distance. The angle beta concept is discussed in detail and the electron pseudo-arc therapy technique used at McGill is described. Also presented is the method used to achieve dose homogeneity in target volumes treated with the pseudo-arc technique
