Methods of removing the effects of linear accelerator (linac) output fluctuation from electronic portal images are described and compared. The output of the linac is measured using a specially constructed large-area ionization chamber during imaging and recorded with the image. The use of a dose-rate signal directly from the linac monitor chamber is discussed. Various versions of a quadratic thickness calibration scheme are tested, incorporating linac output data measured by the ionization chamber. Experimental results are presented showing that the incorporation of data from the ionization chamber gives improved absolute calibration accuracy and flatness. Immediately after calibration, the mean systematic thickness error in calibration of a uniform 136.8 mm water-equivalent slab was shown to be no more than 0.6 mm with a thickness variation within each image also of no more than +/-0.8 mm. This was true even when imaging with an unstable linac beam giving mean thickness errors between images of 8.8 mm and variations within each image of +/-4.9 mm without the ionization chamber correction. Up to one month after calibration, use of the ionization chamber to remove short-term linac fluctuations is shown to still keep mean thickness errors to less than 1.6 mm with variations within each image of no more than +/-1.4 mm
