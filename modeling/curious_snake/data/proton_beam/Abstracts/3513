The investigation of 26 acromegalic patients long after irradiation of the pituitary body with a proton beam showed clinical and hormonal improvement in 38% of the patients, clinical improvement without complete growth hormone normalization in 46%, and the absence of any effect in 15%. The latter was mainly a result of partial irradiation of pituitary adenoma. Some patients after proton irradiation demonstrated signs of adenohypophyseal functional insufficiency, more marked in patients with a decreased level of Gy (over 5 ng/ml). A conclusion is that proton beam therapy is effective (provided all criteria for patients' eligibility are observed) and can be used as an independent method for the treatment of acromegalic patients
