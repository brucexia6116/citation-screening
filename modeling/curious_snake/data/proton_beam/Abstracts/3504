Boag's theory is applied to thimble and plane parallel ionisation chambers using previously determined swept area dimensions and electron beam characteristics. The results obtained were compared with those obtained by measurements performed with lithium borate discs, by application of the 'equivalent dose per pulse' empirical method and the 'two voltage' method. All the results were in reasonable agreement
