BACKGROUND: Little is known about the risks, effects and results of phacoemulsification following treatment with different modalities of choroidal melanoma. METHODS: In a retrospective study, records were evaluated of 72 patients who underwent cataract surgery after treatment of choroidal melanoma (35 were treated with iodine-125 plaques, 27 with ruthenium-106 plaques, eight by tumor excision, and two with proton beam irradiation). The data were analyzed with respect to complications, effects on postoperative tumor care and visual outcome. RESULTS: Phacoemulsification was performed at a mean interval of 21.5 months after primary tumor therapy. An intraocular lens (IOL) was implanted in 93% of the cases. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 16.2 months. Preoperative problems were rubeosis iridis (30.5%), secondary glaucoma (34.7%) and posterior synechiae (41.6%). Intraoperatively, defects of the posterior capsule occurred in 12.5%. Visual acuity equal to or better than preoperative vision was found in 95.8% of the patients as the best postoperative measurement and in 72.2% at the last follow-up measurement. A deterioration of more than two lines in visual acuity was observed in 4.2% as the best postoperative vision and in 27.8% at the last documented examination. Phacoemulsification was not the cause of deterioration in any of the cases. After cataract surgery, tumor retreatment was necessary in 19.4%. Treatment of radiation retinopathy was performed for the first time in 13.8%. Metastases developed in six patients (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Phacoemulsification following treatment for choroidal melanoma is both possible and advisable. The majority of patients have enhanced visual acuity. No decrease of vision occurred as a result of cataract extraction. The postoperative care of intraocular tumors and the treatment of radiation retinopathy is improved by timely cataract surgery
