A time delay in a respiratory gating system could cause an unexpected phase mismatch for synchronized gating radiotherapy. This study presents a method of identifying and measuring the time delay in a gating system. Various port films were taken for a motion phantom at different gating window levels with a very narrow window size. The time delay for the gating system was determined by comparing the motion curve (the position of a moving object versus the gating time) measured in the port films to the motion curve determined by the video cameras. The measured time delay for a linac-based gating system was 0.17+/-0.03 s. This time delay could induce target missing if it was not properly taken into account for the synchronized gating radiotherapy. Measurement/verification of the time delay should be considered as an important part of the accepting/commissioning test before the clinical use of the gating system
