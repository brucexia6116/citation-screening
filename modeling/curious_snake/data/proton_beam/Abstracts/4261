High energy, high-Z (HZE) particles are present in high-altitude and high-inclination satellite orbits. Most of the HZE dose above LET = 200 keV/micrometer is due to Fe nuclei. Individual HZE particles can damage several cells adjacent to one another along the particle track in tissue. The outcome has been described as a "microlesion" by D. Grahn. The present study attempts to define conditions for microlesions in specific tissues, to seek biological evidence that microlesions are produced, and to evaluate the microlesion as a potentially useful unit of dose in assessing hazards to spaceworkers. Microlesions in individuals cells and hair follicles have been described. Microbial studies have provided some evidence for independent secondary electron action. Whether or not a few hundred microlesions would be damaging to the whole organism depends upon the nature of damage to critical tissues. For example, cancer may occur if microlesions kill several cells in a straight line and mutate other cells alongside the particle track. Fe particle irradiation of the mouse Harderian gland (Fry et al., this issue) produces tumors efficiently. Microlesions in the lens, cornea, and retina need to be considered. Further dialogue is required before a final decision can be made concerning the most appropriate way to assess the HZE hazard
