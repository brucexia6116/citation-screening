Cavernous angiomas, although rare, represent a clinical and a neuroradiological challenge in the differential diagnosis of cerebrovascular malformations. We report about three cases with a total of seven cavernous angiomas. Clinical features include intracerebral hemorrhage, epileptic seizures and focal neurological signs. Diagnosis is based on typical findings in MRI in combination with an angiography presenting a normal vascular situation or an avascular mass lesion, whereas CT-scan shows nonspecific features. Surgical removal is generally recommended, but could not be done in our cases. A histological verification of a clinically typical diagnosis is not mandatory. Indication for proton beam irradiation still has to be discussed. A definite therapeutical approach will have to consider the natural history in a larger number of cases
