PURPOSE: To observe the patterns of radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis (TLN) following radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-five proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic (1H MRS) examinations were acquired from 13 healthy adult volunteers for comparison with data from the patient population. There were 18 patients (28 spectra) with radiologic evidence of TLN and all patients were confirmed cases of NPC treated with radiation therapy. Six patients (33%) had a single treatment while 12 (67%) patients had two treatments. All 1H MRS examinations were performed on a 2-T whole body system (Bruker) using the point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) method with TE = 135 ms, TR = 3000 ms, and data processed automatically using the LCModel software package for metabolite quantification. RESULTS: The N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) levels were reduced in all except one spectrum (96%). Choline (Cho) was increased in 3 (11%), normal in 4 (14%), and reduced in 21 (75%) spectra. The creatine (Cr) level was normal in 8 (29%) spectra and reduced in 20 (71%) spectra. In four patients with normal imaging findings 1H MRS was abnormal. CONCLUSION: 1H MRS can characterize radiation-induced TLN. Spectra with increased Cho can be mistaken for neoplasm. Spectroscopy can also identify metabolic derangement before imaging
