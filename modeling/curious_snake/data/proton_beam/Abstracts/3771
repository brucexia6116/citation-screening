A stereotactic convergent beam irradiation technique using a linear accelerator has been developed in order to precisely apply single high doses of up to 50 gray and more to brain lesions (radiosurgery). Accurate positioning of the patient and the target point of irradiation is an absolute requirement for this method. The stereotactic localization system developed for this purpose is described
