Modern techniques in radiation oncology, such as fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) allow the application of high local doses to defined treatment volumes, while normal structures in close vicinity can be spared; high local control rates can be achieved, while treatment-related toxicity can be minimized. Innovative Hi-Art tomotherapy systems offer an alternative, combining a 6 MV photon accelerator with a CT scanner. Ion beams, such as protons and carbon ions, have been shown to be beneficial for distinct tumor entities. Both offer a characteristic physical dose distribution with an inverse dose profile contributing to beneficial dose conformality. Carbon ions also offer the advantage of increased relative biological effectiveness. For certain tumor types, a significant increase in local control and survival rates could be obtained with carbon ions. [References: 13]
