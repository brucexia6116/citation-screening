Positron Emission Tomography(PET) and Proton Chemical Shift Imaging(1H-CSI) has provided a cerebral metabolism. The glucose analog fluorine-18 fluorodeoxy-glucose(FDG) and amino acid analog 11C-L-methionine is the most commonly used PET tumor tracer. This time we compare with 1H-CSI and PET in gliomas and metastatic brain tumor with computer-assisted fusion images. We experienced some cases of the brain tumor. One case is metastatic brain tumor after radiation therapy, localized in right parietal hemisphere, with hemorrhage, and slightly accumulated Gd-DTPA in tumors. 11C-methionine PET demonstrates defects in tumors, but slight accumulated surrounding tumors. Accumulation of PET lesion is not elevated choline in CSI, but lactate is accumulated in tumors. Choline signal elevation seen in brain neoprasms, associated with increased cellular proliferation. Accumulation of PET and another accumulation of lactate in tumor are not demonstrate recurrence. Fusion image of PET and CSI is useful in understanding metabolism of brain tumor
