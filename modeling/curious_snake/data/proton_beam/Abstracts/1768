PURPOSE: Conformal stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy using a linear accelerator and a micromultileaf collimator (mMLC) offer the possibility of irradiating irregularly shaped target volumes. Dynamic arc radiosurgery and radiotherapy, i.e., stereotactic radiation therapy combining a moving gantry with a dynamic mMLC, enable the radiation even of lesions with concave structures. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The dynamic arc method requires additional tools for quality assurance (QA) and three-dimensional verification at a high spatial resolution. A QA program was developed. Dose distributions of planning target volumes with concavities were investigated in polymer gel phantoms. The radiation-induced change of the relaxation rate R(2) was measured by magnetic resonance imaging. The distributions were compared with image processing tools. RESULTS: Using the therapy-planning software BrainSCAN 4.0 (and 4.1 beta) in combination with the mMLC m3, deviations between the planned and measured 90% isodoses of about 2 mm were registered in the isocenter plane. Three-dimensional verification was feasible in the range of accuracy achieved in planning and dose measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic arc radiosurgery and radiotherapy offer excellent conformation even for complicated planning target volumes with concavities. The dose distribution calculated with the treatment-planning software used can be accomplished with the available equipment. Patients can be treated by dynamic arc radiosurgery and radiotherapy
