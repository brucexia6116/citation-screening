To clarify the contribution of apoptosis to cell death in four human solid tumor cell lines, clonogenic cell survival (indicator of radiosensitivity) and induction of caspase-3 (CASP-3)/caspase-3-like proteases (CASP-3LP) and the production of DNA fragmentation (markers for apoptosis) were studied in RKO, LS174T, MCF7 and TE671 cells exposed to DNA-incorporated Auger-electron-emitting (125)I (5-[(125)I]iodo-2'-deoxyuridine) or gamma-radiation. Clonogenic survival was assessed by colony-forming assay, CASP-3/CASP-3LP induction with a fluorogenic substrate and DNA fragmentation by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. For (125)I, log dose-survival curves had no shoulder [high-linear-energy-transfer (LET)-like] and decreased exponentially at different rates in various cell lines. Induction of CASP-3/CASP-3LP in radiosensitive RKO and LS174T cells was threefold greater than that in radioresistant TE671 and MCF7 cells. Nucleosomal laddering in (125)I-radiosensitive cell lines was dose-dependent, and no laddering was detected in radioresistant lines. For gamma-radiation, the survival curve for LS174T cells was monoexponential and that for the other lines exhibited a distinct shoulder (low-LET-like). The most radiosensitive cell line, LS174T, showed the highest induction of CASP-3/CASP-3LP, and the most radioresistant line, TE671, showed the lowest induction. Although DNA laddering was not detectable in TE671 cells, it was observed in other lines, being most prominent in LS174T cells. We conclude that apoptosis initiated by DNA-incorporated (125)I is dose-dependent, correlates with cell radiosensitivity and takes place through a CASP-3-mediated pathway, whereas that after gamma-irradiation probably occurs via a CASP-3-independent pathway and/or a CASP-3-mediated pathway and does not correlate with cell radiosensitivity
