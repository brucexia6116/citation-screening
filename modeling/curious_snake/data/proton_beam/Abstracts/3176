Previous work has demonstrated that alpha-particle irradiation of primary human bone marrow cells leads to the transmission of chromosomal instability in the descendants of the irradiated cell, although there is some interindividual variation. We have extended these studies to human EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines in order to establish an in vitro model system. The five cell lines analyzed, including one from a Fanconi anaemia patient, exhibited high levels of persistent chromatid aberrations up to approximately 40 cell generations after alpha-irradiation. The p53 status of the cell lines was defined according to whether cellular p53 levels were induced by irradiation, translocated to the nucleus and were able to bind a p53 DNA consensus recognition sequence in vitro. Together with the primary bone marrow cell studies, we conclude that alpha-particle induced chromosomal instability is independent of the p53 status of the cell as defined in these studies
