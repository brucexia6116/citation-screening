From May 1978 to May 1981, a total of 20 patients (18 patients with Non Hodgkin Lymphomas + 2 patients with Stage IV Hodgkin's disease) were treated with chemotherapy and whole or upper abdominal radiotherapy. All the patients were in complete remission at the time of irradiation. Shielding of the kidneys was effected at the start of treatment and the right lobe of the liver was shielded after a dose of 20 Gy was delivered. As of January 1982, 17 of the patients were alive and free of disease with a follow-up ranging from 6 to 32 months (mean follow-up of 18.5 months). Two patients were dead from their disease. Alterations in liver chemistry were observed in 5 patients, clinical jaundice or transient hepatomegaly along with changes in liver chemistry in 4 patients, classical veno-occlusive disease in 2 patients and 7 of the patients did not develop any complication. No death from complications were observed. The contribution of the following factors such as radiotherapy dose to the liver, drugs, nutritional status and associated medical conditions, towards the development of complications have been analyzed in detail
