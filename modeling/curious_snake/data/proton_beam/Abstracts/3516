We have devised a single after-loading applicator, the Martinez Universal Perineal Interstitial Template (MUPIT), which has been used in combination with external beam irradiation to treat 104 patients with either locally advanced or recurrent malignancies of the cervix, vagina, female urethra, prostate, or anorectal region. Twenty-six patients treated for prostate cancer are excluded because of their short follow-up. Local failure developed in 13 of the 78 remaining patients (16.6%)--major complications developed in 4 patients (5.1%). Follow-up has been 1 year to 7 1/2 years; 60/78 patients have been followed for more than 2 years. All local recurrences and complications occurred before 18 months. The device consists of two acrylic cylinders, an acrylic template with an array of holes that serve as guides for trocars, and a cover plate. In use, the cylinders are placed in the vagina and/or rectum or both and then fastened to the template so that a fixed geometric relationship among the tumor volume, normal structures, and source placement is preserved throughout the course of the implantation. Appropriate computer programs have been developed to calculate the dose from these implants. The advantages of the system are (a) greater control of the placement of sources relative to the tumor volume and critical structures, as a result of the fixed geometry provided by the template and cylinders, and (b) improved dose-rate distributions obtained by means of computerized optimization of the source placement and strength during the planning phase. We conclude that the local control rate (83.4%) with low morbidity (5.1%) achieved with the combination of external beam irradiation and MUPIT applicator in these patients with locally advanced malignancies represents an improvement over previous published results with other applicators
