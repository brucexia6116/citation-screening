The authors described methods of cervical cancer therapy performed in 1970 using the proton beam of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics and analyzed long-term results. The use of protons resulted in homogeneous irradiation of a preset target volume without injuring the adjacent organs and tissues. Proton beam irradiation of the uterus was combined with gamma-beam therapy of the zones of regional metastatic spreading. Postradiation reactions were unobserved in the adjacent bladder and rectum in patients receiving combined therapy and irradiation alone. The clinical efficacy of proton beam irradiation was confirmed by the treatment of 160 patients
