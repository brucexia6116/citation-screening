Respiration-gated radiotherapy for tumor sites affected by respiratory motion will potentially improve radiotherapy outcomes by allowing reduced treatment margins leading to decreased complication rates and/or increased tumor control. Furthermore, for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), respiratory gating will minimize the hot and cold spot artifacts in dose distributions that may occur as a result of interplay between respiratory motion and leaf motion. Most implementations of respiration gating rely on the real time knowledge of the relative position of the internal anatomy being treated with respect to that of an external marker. A method to determine the amplitude of motion and account for any difference in phase between the internal tumor motion and external marker motion has been developed. Treating patients using gating requires several clinical decisions, such as whether to gate during inhale or exhale, whether to use phase or amplitude tracking of the respiratory signal, and by how much the intrafraction tumor motion can be decreased at the cost of increased delivery time. These parameters may change from patient to patient. A method has been developed to provide the data necessary to make decisions as to the CTV to PTV margins to apply to a gated treatment plan
