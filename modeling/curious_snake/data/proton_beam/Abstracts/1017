ICRP Publication 92 presents a proposal to achieve coherence between radiation weighting factors and quality factors. In particular, the radiation weighting factors for incident protons and neutrons have been revised and new values have been proposed. On the basis of the proposed values, sets of conversion coefficients fluence-to-effective dose for protons and neutrons have been derived for the irradiation geometries of interest for cosmic ray dosimetry.
