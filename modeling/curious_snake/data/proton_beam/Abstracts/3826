A technique for rotational total skin electron irradiation is presented in which the patient stands on a slowly rotating platform (SSD = 285 cm) in a large uniform linear accelerator electron field (Eo = 3.5 MeV). The beam is scattered by the transmission ionization chamber and by a special lead/aluminum scattering filter, and then degraded by a sheet of Lucite. A Farmer chamber is used as a patient dose monitor and a method for absolute dose calibration is presented. The field is uniform to within +/- 5% for dimensions of 180 X 40 cm2. The surface dose for rotational therapy is equal to 45% of the maximum dose in a stationary beam. The rotating beam exhibits a dose maximum on the surface, falls to 80% at 0.5 cm and has an x-ray contamination of approximately 4%. The surface dose rate is about 25 cGy/min for the rotating beam. The rotational beam percentage depth dose distributions, calculated using stationary beam information, agree well with measured data. The stationary beam exhibits a dose maximum at 4 mm in tissue, a surface dose of 93%, 80% dose at a depth of 1 cm, a practical range of 1.75 cm, and an x-ray contamination of 2.5%. The rotational total skin electron irradiation significantly reduces the patient treatment and setup time and solves the problem of beam matching, when compared to standard multiple-beam techniques
