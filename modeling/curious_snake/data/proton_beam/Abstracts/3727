The feasibility of using PET for proton dose monitoring is examined here in detail. First experimental studies in a Lucite phantom have been performed at the medical TRIUMF proton beamline for proton energies of 62 MeV and 110 MeV. The proton dose delivered to the phantom ranged from 16 Gy up to 317 Gy. The induced activity was analysed 20-40 min after the irradiation with a PET scanner. The obtained depth activity profiles were compared to our calculation based on a model using available isotope production cross-section data. Both the observed absolute count rates and the activity profiles were found to agree very well with this model. Effects such as proton range straggling, inelastic nuclear interactions and the energy spectrum of the emitted positrons were studied in detail and found to change the activities by 5-10%. The lateral deposition of dose in the phantom could be very well localized by the induced activity. However, the spatial correlation between dose depth profiles and depth activity profiles was found to be poor, hence the extraction of isodose profiles from activity profiles seems to be very difficult
