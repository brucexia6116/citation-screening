The purpose of this work was to determine the w-value of air for protons using the paired gas method. Several plastic- and magnesium-walled chambers were used with air, synthetic air, nitrogen, and argon flowing gases. Using argon as a reference gas, the w-value of air was measured and ranged from 32.7 to 34.5 J/C for protons with energies encountered in radiotherapy. Using nitrogen as a reference gas, the w-value of air ranged from 35.2 to 35.4 J/C over the same range of proton energies. The w-value was found, at a given energy, to be independent of the ion chamber used. The uncertainty in these measurements was estimated at 5.2% at the 2sigma level. This uncertainty was dominated by the 4.4% uncertainty in the w-value of the reference gas
