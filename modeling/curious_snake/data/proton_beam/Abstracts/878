We have just started the basic study to detect the genetic alterations at chromosome level as a result of radioadaptive response. The assay system is based upon the analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) induced in human lymphoblastoid cell TK6, which were pre-irradiated with low-doses of ionizing radiation (IR) before the challenging irradiation. In our previous study, this analysis was shown to be very sensitive to IR because the radiation-specific hemizygous LOHs (interstitial deletions) were observed after 10 cGy of IR (X-rays or accelerated carbon-ion beam). Here, we would like to introduce our plan how to detect the changes in such radiation-specific LOH patterns by the pre-irradiation of TK6. If we succeed the detection, the radioadaptation assay system can be used for elucidating the biological effects of low-doses of space ionizing radiation. In addition, we are also considering the modification of assay system by introducing the site-specific chromosome breakage (DNA double-strand break) instead of challenging IR. Furthermore, the preliminary results of the experiments using frozen TK6 cells for the preparation of ISS experiments
