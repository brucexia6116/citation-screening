The induction of inactivation and mutation to thioguanine-resistance in cultured human diploid fibroblasts was studied after exposure to ionising radiations with LET's in the range 20--470 keV micrometer-1. Unique r.b.e. values were obtained for inactivation and mutation induction with nine different qualities of radiation. The plot of r.b.e. verus LET gave humped curves for both endpoints; r.b.e. maxima were in the LET range 90--200 keV micrometer-1 but the maximum r.b.e. value for mutation induction was almost twice that for inactivation. The accuracy of estimates of mutation induction are discussed with regard to possible selective effects against mutants during post-irradiation growth
