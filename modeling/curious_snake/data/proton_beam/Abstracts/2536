One hundred sixty-four patients with uveal melanoma were treated with helium ion irradiation prior to May 1984, and the data were analyzed in June 1989. Most uveal melanomas were large, with a mean tumor thickness of 6.5 mm; approximately 60% of the patients had tumors that extended anterior to the equator. A complete follow-up was obtained for all patients. One hundred twelve patients were alive at the time of this report; 18% of the patients developed clinical and laboratory evidence of metastases and eventually died of widespread tumor. Eighty-four percent of eyes were retained. Data were analyzed with a number of parametric and nonparametric techniques. Larger tumors and those located in close proximity to the optic nerve and fovea had a higher incidence of most complications, especially visual loss
