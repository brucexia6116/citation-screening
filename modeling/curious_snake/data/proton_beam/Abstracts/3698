Total skin low energy electron beam irradiation is used to treat superficially widespread skin lesions such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Total skin irradiation involves delivering an adequate dose at a depth of 0.25 to 1.0 cm, while sparing underlying tissue. The dose distributions obtained when using a modified Stanford six-field technique depend upon the beam energy, the beam angle, the diameter and shape of the body part, and other variables. The dose distribution uniformity of six pairs of angulated electron beams has been studied as a function of beam energy, the gantry angle, +/- theta, above and below the horizontal and the diameter of a cylindrical polystyrene phantom. Depth doses and dose uniformity for single and multiple fields have been measured as a function of beam energy, phantom diameter and position
