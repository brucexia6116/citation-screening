Our institutional experience using the Peacock system for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is summarized. Over 100 patients were treated using this system, which is fitted to a Clinac 600C linac. Both cranial and extracranial lesions have been treated using this modality. Immobilization is achieved either with the Talon system for cranial sites or an Aquaplast cast. Target volumes up to 500 cm3 have been treated. Multiple lesions (up to 3) were treated in one setup. The range of dose/fractionation schemes used was 15 Gy/1 fx (radiosurgical treatment) - 80 Gy/40 fx. Dose validation studies were carried out using film and ion chamber dosimetry in a specially designed phantom. Optimal dose distributions were attainable using inverse treatment planning for IMRT delivery. These were found to encompass the target volumes accurately using dose validation phantom studies. Immobilization methods used were accurate to within 1 mm, as evidenced by daily portal films. IMRT using the Peacock system offers the advantage of delivery of conformal therapy to high doses safely and accurately. This provides the opportunity for dose escalation studies, retreatment of previously treated tumors, as well as treating multiple targets in one setup. The system may be fitted to a conventional linac without major modifications
