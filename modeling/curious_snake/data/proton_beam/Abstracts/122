Optimization of the dose distributions by individual beam compensation is a useful tool in conformal radiation therapy. Intensity modulation by electromagnetic scanning of a narrow elementary beam allows fast dose delivery and causes little change in beam quality compared with other methods, especially for high energies such as 50 MV. Intensity modulated beams from the MM50 accelerator were measured and compared with calculations based on Monte Carlo simulations. Good agreement between measurements and calculations were found, typically within 1% for central dose profiles. The steepest wedge angle that was produced with the scanning beam technique was of 45 degrees or 3.5% cm(-1) for a 20 cm x 20 cm field, slightly varying with depth. The elementary 50 MV photon 'pencil beam' for a full range, high-z bremsstrahlung target, is a wide dose distribution at 10 cm depth in water which limits the modulation gradient and hence the complexity of the modulation by the scanning of a photon pencil beam only. Scanned wedge beam distributions were modelled in the treatment planning system and a pelvic treatment with three fields was used to illustrate a clinical application. The resulting dose volume data were compared for different radiation qualities but with similar beam portals. 'Energy modulation' by field matching with lower photon energies was performed to sharpen the penumbra towards organs at risk
