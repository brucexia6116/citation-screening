The objective of this study was to perform comparative dosimetric studies of both 106Ru/106Rh plaque brachytherapy and external beam proton therapy proposed for ocular treatments at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. These modalities were also compared with traditional 125I plaque brachytherapy. Using a standardised eye model with a representative ocular melanoma tumour, the relative dose distributions within the tumour and surrounding tissue were calculated using the Monte Carlo code MCNPX. Published absorbed dose distributions benchmarked the Monte Carlo models. Results indicate that the proton beam provided superior dose uniformity within the tumour volume, whereas the dose distribution from 106Ru/106Rh was more heterogeneous. Relative to 125I COMS plaque, both 106Ru/106Rh and protons have shown more confined dose distributions to the tumour volume in this situation, thus sparing other critical ocular structures. For protons, it has been shown that only doses lower than the maximum dose are delivered outside the tumour volume. Depending on the clinical situation, this may aid in the sparing of critical structures located in the sclera and optic disc boundary. The Monte Carlo model's statistical uncertainties of the mean dose estimates for the 106Ru/106Rh plaque and proton beam were 3 and 2.5%, respectively
