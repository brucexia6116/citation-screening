The feasibility of dynamic conformal heavy charged particle radiotherapy has been investigated at UCLBL, and shows high promise of: 1. an improved therapeutic ratio and 2. reduction in the number of treatment portals required for efficient treatment delivery. Assessment of dose to tumor and critical structures for several anatomical sites have been carried out using a normal tissue complication algorithm developed at LBL. For high-LET charged particle treatment delivery, dynamic conformal therapy using a raster scanned beam with variable modulation and multileaf collimator appears to be the optimal technique for treatment delivery.
