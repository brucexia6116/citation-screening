G0 human lymphocytes were exposed in vitro to plutonium-239 alpha-particles, with doses ranging from 0 to 1.62 Gy, to provide a dose response curve and to compare complex rearrangements produced by high LET radiation with low LET data from previous work. Metaphase chromosomes 1 and 2 were painted using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) whole chromosome probes. All unstable and stable aberrations involving the painted chromosomes were scored. The whole genome corrected alpha-coefficient for dicentrics was 0.244 +/- 0.023 and for total translocations 0.346 +/- 0.032, when considering simple and complex exchanges. The ratio of bicoloured total translocations to bicoloured dicentrics was 1.21 +/- 0.15 and the ratio of 2-way to 1-way translocations was 1.73 +/- 0.27 for apparently simple exchanges only. A correlation was noted between the distributions of dicentrics and translocations and this applied even when the complex rearrangements were removed. 20% of the observed rearrangements were complex and this observation was independent of dose. Qualitatively, following irradiation with alpha-particles the complex rearrangements observed were of a greater complexity than seen after X- or gamma-rays. Using the Savage and Simpson system to classify the complex rearrangements, the higher order complexes were found to be the most common type observed. However the insertion type increased while the 2F + 2G types decreased when complex rearrangements induced by alpha-particles were compared to those formed after X- or gamma-irradiation
