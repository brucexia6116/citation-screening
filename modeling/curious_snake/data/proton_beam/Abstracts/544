Principles of therapy are similar for Ewing's sarcoma and osteosarcoma. Chemotherapy or surgery alone cures few patients. Multimodality measures are needed for durable response. Quality of life and function are very important short- and long-term considerations. The spine, sacrum, pelvis, ankle, hand, mediastinum, pulmonary hilum, and chest wall are examples of bone cancer locations for which surgery is difficult. Patients with positive margins may need radiation and may experience systemic therapy delay, recurrence, loss of function, or any combination of these. When radiation is used as a means of local control, concomitant chemotherapy can increase its effectiveness. Options for difficult Ewing's sarcoma and osteosarcoma situations and multimodality solutions, including 1 mCi/kg of samarium and proton therapy, are discussed. Combination radiation and chemotherapy regimens are summarized, and organization of patients, caregivers, and medical teams for multimodality therapy is described, along with tools used in our institution that aid in this process.
