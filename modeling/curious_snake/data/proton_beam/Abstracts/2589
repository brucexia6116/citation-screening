Since 1954, 39 cases of glomus jugulare or vagale tumor have been treated by the authors with radiotherapy. The initial results with orthovoltage (280 kV) therapy were unpredictable, but 30 patients with 32 tumors treated with megavoltage radiotherapy (Cobalt-60 [60Co] or linear accelerator) have shown either no evidence of recurrence or complications, with one exception, or died of causes unrelated to their glomus tumor. Megavoltage radiotherapy is recommended for primary treatment of all glomus tumors that present with evidence of bone invasion or nerve involvement
