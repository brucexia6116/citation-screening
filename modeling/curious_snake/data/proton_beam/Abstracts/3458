A new beam line for radiotherapy and radiosurgery with accelerated helium-ion beams has been set up at the Bevalac. The new treatment room has been equipped with a very precise patient positioner in order to utilize the superior dose localization properties of light-ion beams. The beam spreading and shaping system is described, the trade-offs involved in positioning the beam modifying devices are discussed, and the physical properties of the generated radiation fields are reported. The Bragg peak modulation by axial beam stacking employing a variable range shifter is explained and the control system including beam monitoring and dosimetry is presented
