The authors described the results of combined radiotherapy of 219 cervical cancer patients, stage TIBN0M0, of them 47 were treated by routine intracavitary gamma-beam therapy including intracavitary irradiation based on the principle of successive administration of low activity radionuclide sources and 134 patients-by that of high activity radionuclide sources. Gamma-beam therapy was of one type. There was no significant difference in 5-year survival rates in patients treated by combined radiotherapy including intracavitary gamma-beam therapy based on the principle of successive administration of low or high activity radionuclides. However, the survival rate in them as compared to that in patients treated by intracavitary irradiation of common type, was much higher. Rectal complications were most frequent in patients treated by routine radiotherapy, bladder complications were noted in patients treated by successive administration of high activity radionuclide sources
