PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of spot scanning proton beam therapy (PT) in the curative treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) in adults patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 13 STS patients treated with PT between July 1998 and May 2005 in our institutional database. Tumor histology varied with the most common histologic subtypes including liposarcoma and peripheral nerve sheet tumor. All tumors were located in vicinity of critical structures, such as the spinal cord, optic apparatus, bowel, kidney, or bowel. Of the patients, 6 and 5 patients received PT either as adjuvant therapy for non-R0 resection or for recurrence, respectively. Two patients received radical PT for unresectable disease. The median prescribed dose was 69.4 CGE (CGE = proton Gy x 1.1)-Gy (range, 50.4-76.0) at 1.8 to 2 CGE-Gy (median, 1.9) per fraction. Pre-PT anthracycline-based chemotherapy was delivered to 3 patients only. No patient has been lost to follow-up (median 48.1 months, range, 19.1-100.7 months). RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, all but 2 patients were alive. Local recurrence developed in 3 (23%) patients. The administered dose to these patients was < or =60 Gy-CGE. Distant control was achieved in all but 2 patients (lung metastasis), 1 of whom presented with a concomitant local recurrence. The 4-year local control and metastasis-free survival rates were 74.1% and 84.6%, respectively. Late grade > or =2 toxicity was observed in only 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Spot scanning PT is an effective and safe treatment for patient with STS in critical locations. The observed toxicity rate was acceptable
