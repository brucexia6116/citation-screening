Since the Hammersmith cyclotron was removed, the earlier therapy results have been extensively re-examined. The overall experiences can be summarized as follows: 1. A total neutron dose of 1560 cGy given in twelve equally spaced fractions over 20 days seems to be the optimum. Neutrons, therefore, provide a treatment option with great advantage with respect to patient management. 2. Rapid tumour regression is an important often ignored effect, leading to a quick relief of pain and other serious symptoms in the patient. 3. Due to the high incidence of complete regression complicated surgery can be avoided in many cases. Tissue deficits can be often covered by modern methods of surgery repair. 4. Local control rates are as high as 60 to 80% of the advanced tumours. They improve the quality of life and reduce the cost of continuing patients' care
