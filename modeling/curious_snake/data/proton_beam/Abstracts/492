Novel therapy as part of sarcoma treatment schemas can enhance quality of life and is important in improving outcomes of high-risk sarcomas. Additional chemotherapy and biotherapy options to reduce tumor burden and prevent metastases include intra-arterial chemotherapy in osteosarcoma; intrapleural chemotherapy, aerosol 9-nitrocamptothecin, or protracted irinotecan and temozolomide in Ewing's sarcoma; continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion for malignancy involving the peritoneum, such as desmoplastic small round cell tumor; and ifosfamide with muramyl tripeptide phosphatidyl ethanolamine liposomes in osteosarcoma. These treatments bring improved control of symptoms, including reduction in nausea, mucositis, cardiotoxicity, and central nervous system toxicity. Portable infusion devices have facilitated introduction of outpatient doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and methotrexate regimens and home-infusion irinotecan. Physical approaches to eliminate sarcoma tumors and metastases are critical for durable responses. Novel local control measures include embolization before surgery, radiosensitization, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy during chemo-radiotherapy, proton therapy, samarium, thermal ablation (radiofrequency ablation), and cryoablation.
