At the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the Northern California Oncology Group, a preliminary study of heavy charged particle radiotherapy in soft tissue and bone sarcoma has been carried out. Fifty-two patients with bone or soft tissue tumors were treated wholly or in part with heavy charged particles from 1978 to 1985. Eleven patients, considered inevaluable for purposes of this analysis, received less than 50 Gray-equivalents (GyE) because of the following: progressive disease (three patients); palliative treatment due to recurrent disease after previous radiation therapy (three patients); or since they were part of preliminary studies of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) (five patients). Forty-one patients received from 50 to 78.5 GyE, with a mean of 65 GyE. They had an average of 23 months follow-up, ranging from 4 to 78 months. In patients with paraspinal chondrosarcoma 9 of 11 had local control, with a mean follow-up time of 32 months. In the remaining patients with other histologies, 19 of 30 were controlled within the irradiated area, with a mean follow-up time of 20 months. Serious complications were encountered in the CNS (four patients), in the bowel (one patient), and in bone (one patient). Heavy charged particle radiotherapy appears to be of value in treating bone or soft tissue sarcoma; further trials are planned
