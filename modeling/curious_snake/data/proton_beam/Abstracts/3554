Production rates of the activation of oxygen and nitrogen by high-energy x-ray beams from medical accelerators were measured as functions of the accelerator energy. A technique was developed in which the air-activation production rates are used to evaluate the concentration of radioactive gas in the treatment room and the dose received by the technologist who operates the accelerator. It was found that for typical operating conditions of medical accelerators, the dose received by personnel entering the treatment room is negligible compared to the maximum permissible dose limit
