From February 1981 to January 1984, 20 patients with a tumor of the upper clivus received proton irradiation at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory. For 15 patients with known neurovisual status (including visual acuity, color vision, visual field, and fundus examinations) we obtained a cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the optic nerves (ON) and the optic chiasm. The prescribed tumor doses ranged from 66.6 to 74.4 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) with a daily fraction size of 1.8 to 2.1 CGE. CGE is used because modulated protons have an RBE of 1.1 compared to 60Co. The follow-up ranged from 30 to 68 months (median 52). Two patients developed, 10 and 36 months post irradiation, a progressive visual deterioration affecting both eyes. This was attributed to an ON and a chiasm injury in one patient and to bilateral ON injury in the other patient. In the first patient, the dose-volume analysis indicated that approximately half of the ON and of the chiasm had received 65 CGE and 55 CGE, respectively. In the second patient, it indicated that a quarter of the left ON (LON) had received 55 CGE whereas the dose to the right ON (RON) was significantly less. This patient had diabetes mellitus which may be a predisposing factor. From this study, a complication rate of 20% (1/5) is observed when a substantial portion of the ON is taken to 65 CGE, while it doesn't exceed 12.5% (2/16) and 7.5% (1/13) at 55 CGE for the ON and for the chiasm, respectively. This suggests a tolerance dose implying a 10% rate of major complications close to 55 CGE. When a tumor requires a high radiation-dose, the exclusion of these structures at 55 to 60 Gy is recommended
