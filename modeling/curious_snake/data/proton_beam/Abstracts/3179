It is known experimentally that a wedge transmission factor depends upon the field size and depth of measurement in particular. Dependence of the transmission upon depth has been attributed to a hardening of the incident beam through the filter, which preferentially absorbs the low-energy photon of the bremsstrahlung component of that beam. We have attempted to separate this hardening effect from that of increased phantom scatter due to dose gradient induced by the wedge filter. Using an experimental wedge machined from cerrobend, the filter transmission at depth is measured and redefined relative to an "equally hardened" beam, obtained by filtering through a flat slab of equal thickness at the center of the wedge. Results of the Co-60, 4-, and 8-MV wedged beams indicate that nearly half of the increase in the transmission at depth is due to the effect of dose-gradient scatter in polystyrene phantom. Based on a simple relationship between primary and scattering radiation, an algebraic presentation is indeed in support of the dose gradient resulting in apparent increase in the wedge factors, at depth
