Measurement of radiation isocenter is a fundamental part of commissioning and quality assurance (QA) for a linear accelerator (linac). In this work we present an automated procedure for the analysis of the stars-shots employed in the radiation isocenter determination. Once the star-shot film has been developed and digitized, the resulting image is analyzed by scanning concentric circles centered around the intersection of the lasers that had been previously marked on the film. The center and the radius of the minimum circle intersecting the central rays are determined with an accuracy and precision better than 1% of the pixel size. The procedure is applied to the position and size determination of the radiation isocenter by means of the analysis of star-shots, placed in different planes with respect to the gantry, couch and collimator rotation axes
