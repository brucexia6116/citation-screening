A simple noninvasive method is described for determining the backscatter to a monitor chamber of a medical accelerator based on the measurement of charge deposited in the target. This method is compared quantitatively to the more elaborate telescopic method for photon beams of 6 MV and 15 MV on linear accelerators having mica and Kapton monitor chambers. The new target charge method gives results consistent with the telescopic method to within 0.3%
