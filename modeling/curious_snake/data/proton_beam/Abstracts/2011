Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced method of conformal radiotherapy. It permits optimal dose distribution to the target volume while preserving surrounding normal tissues. IMRT, with a multileaf collimator, can be realised in two different ways: either the segmented mode, which consists of combining small elementary static field, or the dynamic mode, which consists of moving the leaves while irradiating. The purpose of this work was to study these two methods of modulation on a Varian linear accelerator equipped with a collimator consisting of 40 pairs of one-centimetre-wide leaves. The measurements, obtained by using a diode array, showed that the quality of the irradiation in the dynamic mode does not depend on either the dose rate or the duration of the irradiation. In the segmented mode, weak magnitude segments are preferable, but increase the errors in the delivered dose. Comparisons of various profiles showed that the measured profiles are consistent with those programmed. Both modes seem to be equivalent for step-shaped profiles. In the case of profiles with constant slope, the segmentation generated by the segmented method deteriorates the profile. Even though the choice of technique is strongly dependent on the material available, the dynamic mode presents greater flexibility of use and has been chosen in our institution for IMRT
