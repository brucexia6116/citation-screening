This paper describes the construction of three adult female voxel models, two whole-body and one from head to thighs, from computed tomographic data of 3 women of different stature. Voxel models (also called phantoms) are human models based on computed tomographic or magnetic resonance images obtained from high resolution continuous scans of a single individual. The gray-scale data or information content of the medical images are interpreted into tissues (i.e., organs), a process known as segmentation. The phantoms, consisting of millions of volume elements, called voxels, provide a three-dimensional representation of the human body and the spatial form of its constituent organs and structures. They were initially developed for radiation protection purposes to estimate the organ and effective doses and hence the risk to a person or population due to an irradiation. This paper also presents conversion coefficients for idealized geometries of external photon exposures of energies 10 keV-1 MeV for the three female models, calculated with a Monte Carlo code. Until now there were not any published data on conversion coefficients for explicit female voxel models. Such sets of conversion coefficients exist for voxel adult males or for MIRD-type male, female, and hermaphrodite models. Numerical differences of the calculated conversion coefficients for the voxel female models and MIRD-type models can amount up to 60% or more for external exposures and are due to the improved anatomical realism of the voxel models. The size of the model also has an effect on the conversion coefficients, particularly for deeper lying organs and energies below 200 keV. The three separate sets of conversion coefficients allow one to choose the most suitable model according to the size of the individual as well as to study the dosimetric variations due to the size of the model
