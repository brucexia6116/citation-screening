Electron beams from an accelerator appear to originate from a point away from the vacuum window designated as virtual source. Virtual source to isocenter distances are determined experimentally by measurements in a polystyrene phantom with inverse square law method. Corrections required for percentage depth dose are also determined. Results of our study are compared with that of other investigators
