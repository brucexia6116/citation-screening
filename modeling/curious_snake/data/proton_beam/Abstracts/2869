Taking advantage of the renewal of a linear accelerator, the Radiation Therapy Department of the Centre Leon Berard implemented, in collaboration with Philips Systemes Medicaux, a conformal therapy set-up procedure using CT-scan for 3D treatment planning and a multileaf collimator that allows achievement of numerous irregular-shaped beams via the multileaf preparation system. The various elements of this equipment make possible well defined and structured procedures for treatment planning with different steps and essential tools used by this technique. We describe the means used and indicate future improvements that will lead to automation in order to provide good quality assurance, better security and substantial time saving. During the first year, 115 patients were treated with this new technique. They presented with central nervous system tumors (32 patients), lung cancer (29 patients), prostate cancer (20 patients), paranasal sinus tumors (14 patients) and tumors located in other sites (13 patients with soft sarcoma, hepato-bilary tumor, etc).
