The cytogenetic effects of irradiation were investigated in the bone marrow and corneal epithelium of mice, human white blood cells, and Stamm V79-4 cells of Chinese hamsters exposed to protons with E=9.2 GeV, deutons and helium ions with E=4.6 GeV/nuclon. It was demonstrated that with an increase in the irradiation dose the number of aberrant cells and chromosome aberrations grew. A high yield of exchange type aberrations was found. The proliferative activity of cells of bone marrow decreased and its depletion occurred. The RBE coefficients of high-energy particles varied from 1.3 to 2.7 in relation to the cell type and parameters measured
