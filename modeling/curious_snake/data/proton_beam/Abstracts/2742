Using a previously developed Monte Carlo based model for determining the characteristics of particles scattered from electron beam applicators (cones), the properties of such particles are investigated for the 6 MeV and 12 MeV beams of a Siemens Mevatron KD-2 linear accelerator. Properties examined are energy and angular spectra averaged across the full beam, mean energy and angle and particle number with radial distance from isocentre, and mean energy with angle for particles scattered from each of the three trimmers of the applicator considered. The particles examined are electrons scattered from applicator trimmers, and photons generated in the applicator materials by primary beam electrons. It is found that the properties observed are characteristic of the effective source that each applicator trimmer represents
