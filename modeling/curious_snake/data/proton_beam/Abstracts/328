The vascularization is a very important part of a structure of each tissue both normal, including bone marrow stroma, and pathologically changed. Neoplastic tissues secure supplying in necessary substances for growth and expansion through regulated by its own cells neovasculation. Key role in multipotential cell's differentiation to endothelial cells plays regulatory system consisted of vascular-epithelial growth factor's family (VEGF B, C, D), receptors VEGFR-1, -2, -3, and system Tie2/angiopoetins. Stimulation and importance of angiogenesis for expansion of neoplastic diseases is a current problem in oncology. It is pointed to importance of neovascularization in pathogenesis of acute and chronic leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma. The knowledge of the importance ofvascularization of neoplastic tissues is availing in therapy (researching of substances inhibiting angiogenesis--semaxinib, SU6668, ZD 6474, thalidomid, cetuximab, gefitinib, interferon-alpha, irradiation and others), in diagnostics as a monitoring of a success of the therapy, and in prognosis. Inhibitors ofangiogenesis are antineoplastic drugs with relatively lower toxicity, and lower risk of drug-resistance than conventional chemotherapy what has the importance especially during prolong administration, so they can be an alternative way of therapeutic process. During qualification for antiangiogenic therapy it is necessary to have a consciousness of its limited efficiency. [References: 63]
