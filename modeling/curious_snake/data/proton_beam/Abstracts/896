Malignant diseases of the orbit are multifaceted and require in the majority of the cases an interdisciplinary treatment. Advances in radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy make a high cure rate possible, especially in children's tumors. In adults these tumors reach a tumor control rate of nearly 90 %, even with preservation of the eye in most of the cases. There are only two curative therapy options for tumors in this region: radiotherapy and surgery. The therapy for tumors of the eye and the orbit require the total spectrum of the radiotherapeutic techniques depending on the tumor entity, its spread and localization. In a prevailing number of malignant tumors (tumors of the eyelids, tear glands, orbit, metastases) the application of the radiotherapy as an external, fractionated radiotherapy is standard practice, if necessary in combination with operation and/or chemotherapy. Particularly in the therapy for ocular tumors brachytherapy with radionuclides (e. g., ruthenium) is possible and in a few centers world-wide proton therapy is available. As an alternative procedure in special modalities, stereotactic radiotherapy may be considered. Altogether the new radiotherapy techniques permit a dose increase in the tumor region and/or a reduction of the doses to healthy tissues and lead so to a better local tumor control rate and a decrease in acute and chronic side effects.
