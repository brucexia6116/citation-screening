The purpose of this work was to (a) investigate the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy using 211At-MX35 F(ab')2 or 211At-Rituximab F(ab')2 (nonspecific antibody) against differently advanced ovarian cancer in mice; (b) image the tumor growth on the peritoneum; and (c) calculate the specific energy and mean absorbed dose to tumors and critical organs. METHODS: Two experiments with 5-wk-old nude mice (n = 100 + 93), intraperitoneally inoculated with approximately 1 x 10(7) NIH:OVCAR-3 cells, were done. At either 1, 3, 4, 5, or 7 wk after inoculation animals were intraperitoneally treated with approximately 400 kBq 211At-MX35 F(ab')2 (n = 50 + 45), approximately 400 kBq 211At-Rituximab F(ab')2 (n = 25 + 24), or unlabeled Rituximab F(ab')2 (n = 25 + 24). At the time of treatment 29 animals were sacrificed and biopsies were taken for determination of tumor sizes using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Eight weeks after each treatment the animals were sacrificed and the presence of macro- and microscopic tumors and ascites was determined. The specific energy and mean absorbed dose to tumors were calculated. The activity concentration was measured in critical organs and abdominal fluid. RESULTS: When given treatment 1, 3, 4, 5, or 7 wk after cell inoculation the tumor-free fraction (TFF) was 95%, 68%, 58%, 47%, 26%, and 100%, 80%, 20%, 20%, and 0% when treated with 211At-MX35 F(ab')2 or 211At-Rituximab F(ab')2, respectively. The SEM images revealed maximum tumor radius of approximately 30 mum 1 wk after cell inoculation, increasing to approximately 340 mum at 7 wk. Specific energy to cell nuclei varied between 0 and approximately 540 Gy, depending on assumptions regarding activity distribution and tumor size. The mean absorbed dose to thyroid, kidneys, and bone marrow was approximately 35, approximately 4, and approximately 0.3 Gy, respectively. CONCLUSION: Treatment with 211At-MX35 F(ab')2 or 211At-Rituximab F(ab')2 resulted in a TFF of 95%-100% when the tumor radius was < or =30 microm. The TFF was decreased (TFF < or = 20%) for 211At-Rituximab F(ab')2 when the tumor radius exceeded the range of the alpha-particles. The specific antibody gave for these tumor sizes a significantly better TFF, explained by a high mean absorbed dose (>22 Gy) from the activity bound to the tumor surface and probably some contribution from penetrating activity
