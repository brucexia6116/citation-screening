Gliomas are infiltrative lesions that typically have poorly defined margins on conventional magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images. This presents a considerable challenge for planning radiation and other forms of focal therapy, and introduces the possibility of both under-treating macroscopic tumor, and over-treating regions of normal brain tissue. New therapy systems are able to deliver radiation more precisely and accurately to irregular three-dimensional target volumes, and have placed a premium on definition of the spatial extent of the lesion. Proton MR spectroscopic imaging (H-MRSI) has been proposed as an in vivo molecular imaging technique that assists in targeting and predicts response to radiation therapy for patients with gliomas. The evidence that supports the use of H-MRSI for planning radiation treatment is reviewed, together with the technical requirements for implementing data acquisition and analysis procedures in a clinical setting. Although there is room for improvement in the spatial resolution and chemical specificity obtained at the conventional field strength of 1.5 T, there are clear benefits to integrating H-MRSI into treatment planning and follow-up examinations. Further work is required to integrate the results of the H-MRSI examination into the treatment planning workstation, and to improve the quality of the data using more sensitive phased array coils and higher field strength magnets.
