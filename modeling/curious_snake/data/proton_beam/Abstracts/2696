We report a case of intracranial chordoma revealed by an isolated abducent nerve palsy in a 4 years old boy. We discuss the possible symptoms of intracranial chordomas and their clinical, radiological and histological diagnosis as well as differential diagnosis. We summarize the available therapeutic modalities and we emphasize the future advantages of proton beam therapy in these lesions. [References: 46]
