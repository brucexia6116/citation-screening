Absorbed dose is a quantity which is scientifically rigorously defined and used to quantify the exposure of biological objects, including humans, to ionising radiation. There is, however, no unique relationship between absorbed dose and induced biological effects. The effects induced by a given absorbed dose to a given biological object depend also on radiation quality and temporal distribution of the irradiation. In radiation therapy, empirical approaches are still used today to account for these dependencies in practice. In hadron therapy (neutrons, protons, ions), radiation quality is accounted for with a diversity of (almost hospital specific) methods. The necessity to account for temporal aspects is well known in external beam therapy and in high dose rate brachytherapy. The paper reviews the approaches for weighting the absorbed dose in radiation therapy, and focusses on the clinical aspects of these approaches, in particular the accuracy requirements
