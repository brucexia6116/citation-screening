A total of 119 patients with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate (Stage B and C) were treated at St. Joseph Hospital Houston, Texas from 1971 through 1984 using a combination of radioactive gold seed implant and external irradiation. The prognostic significance of tumor grading and pelvic node involvement was analyzed. Five and 10-year survival for Stage B was 100% and 85% respectively; for Stage C it was 68% and 43% respectively. The cumulative 94% local control rate for Stage B and C cases obtained in this report suggests more effectiveness to control the disease locally with acceptable rate of complications, when radioactive gold seed implant is added
