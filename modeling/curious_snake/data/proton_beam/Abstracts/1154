Values of dose rate constant (DRC) in compliance with AAPM TG 60 formalism recommended for intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) were calculated for different point isotropic mono-energetic photon sources in the energy range E = 20-1000 keV using a semi-analytic model. Based on these DRC values, DRC of some existing models of 192Ir and 125I brachytherapy sources were then calculated using (1) bare energy spectra and (2) a single energy parameter which represents mean energy (photon number weighted or air-kerma weighted) for bare and actual sources or the most probable energy of the spectra (energy line with the highest probability of emission) of the investigated sources (192Ir and 125I). Applicability of the semi-analytic approach was examined by also computing the values of DRC of the investigated sources using MCNP Monte Carlo simulation code (Version 3.1) that involved modeling of the sources accurately. A comparison of values of DRC resulting from MCNP calculations with those resulting from the semi-analytic approach showed that for 192Ir sources the agreement was within 0.40% and for 125I sources it was within 2.3%
