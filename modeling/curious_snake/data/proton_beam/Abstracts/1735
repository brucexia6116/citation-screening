BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: After a review of the main radiosurgical published series, to evaluate our own series of 705 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated by radiosurgery alone or in combination with embolization or surgery. PATIENTS: and method. From January 1984 to December 1998, 705 patients were treated by a multidisciplinary team including neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, radiophysicians and radiotherapists. Age of revelation of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations ranged between birth to 73 years (mean 27, median 25). Age at time of radiosurgery ranged between 7 and 75 years (mean 33, median 31). There were 410 males for 295 females (sex- ratio 1.4). Symptoms of revelation were hemorrhage for 59%, seizures for 23%, headaches for 14% and progressive deficits for 4%. Discovery of cerebral arteriovenous malformation was fortuitous in 4% of cases. Repartition following Spetzler's grading was 12% in grade I, 36% in grade II, 40% in grade III, 12% in grade IV and 0% in grade V. Maximal size ranged between 4 and 60 mm (mean 23, median 20). Volume ranged between 0.2 and 24.3 cc (mean 3.8, median 2.8). Majority of cerebral arteriovenous malformations were large size (42% with size higher than 25 mm) and large volume (54% higher than 10 cc. 54% of patients had treatment prior radiosurgery: 38% had embolization, 10% were operated, 4% were treated by radiosurgery (reirradiation) and 3% were operated and embolized. RESULTS: Overall complete obliteration rate was 55%. The obliteration rate was correlated with size (77% for cAVMs lower than 15 mm, 62% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations between 15 and 25 mm, and 44% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 25 mm), with volume (94% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations lower than 1 cc, 64% between 1 and 4 cc, 48% between 4 and 10 cc, and 62% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 10 cc), dose at reference isodose, minimal dose, morphological parameters (presence of dural components, arteriolovenous fistula, plexiform angioarchitecture, arterial steal, arterial recruitment, deep exclusive drainage, venous plicature, venous confluence, venous ectasia, venous reflux), sectional topography and good recovery of the target. Embolization was a confusion factor not associated with obliteration rate. After multivariate analysis, only Dmin and complete coverage of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations were correlated with obliteration rate. Delay of obliteration was significantly correlated after multivariate analysis with Dmin, complete coverage, arteriolovenulary angioarchitecture (positive correlation) and venous ectasia (negative correlation). CONCLUSION: Overall complete obliteration rate is unreliable data to assess efficacy of radiosurgical method in the tretment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The obliteration rate must be interpretated after stratification on several morphological and dosimetric parameters
