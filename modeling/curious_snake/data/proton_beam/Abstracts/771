In 2002 we fully implemented clinically a commercial Monte Carlo based treatment planning system for electron beams. The software, developed by MDS Nordion (presently Nucletron), is based on Kawrakow's VMC++ algorithm. The Monte Carlo module is integrated with our Theraplan Plustrade mark treatment planning system. An extensive commissioning process preceded clinical implementation of this software. Using a single virtual 'machine' for each electron beam energy, we can now calculate very accurately the dose distributions and the number of MU for any arbitrary field shape and SSD. This new treatment planning capability has significantly impacted our clinical practice. Since we are more confident of the actual dose delivered to a patient, we now calculate accurate three-dimensional (3D) dose distributions for a greater variety of techniques and anatomical sites than we have in the past. We use the Monte Carlo module to calculate dose for head and neck, breast, chest wall and abdominal treatments with electron beams applied either solo or in conjunction with photons. In some cases patient treatment decisions have been changed, as compared to how such patients would have been treated in the past. In this paper, we present the planning procedure and some clinical examples
