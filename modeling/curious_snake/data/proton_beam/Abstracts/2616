Little is known about the action of charged particles of very high linear energy transfer (LET) on human cells and, in particular, the relationship between DNA damage and reproductive death. The aim of this study was to measure the biological efficiency of a low-energy argon beam (E = 7.1 MeV/nucleon, LET = 1590 keV/micron) produced at GSI, Darmstadt, on a human melanoma cell line (CAL4) established in our Institute. Two different methods were used: the micronucleus (MN) test and the colony-forming assay. The MN test, using the cytochalasin-block method, is a measure of genotoxic damage. MN are scored in binucleate cells (BNC) and are formed from acentric fragments or whole chromosomes that have not been incorporated into daughter nuclei at mitosis. The colony-forming assay quantifies reproductive death. Parallel experiments were run with cobalt gamma-rays for comparison. After Co irradiation, the MN-free BNC dose-response curve coincided with that of the loss of colony-forming ability, suggesting the potential of the former as a predictive test of cell killing. After Ar irradiation, there was a dissociation between the two effects, especially at high doses: cell death was greater than the frequency of BNC with MN. The inactivation cross-section was 74 microns2; it was 39 microns2 for MN yield. Therefore, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was higher for cell killing than for MN yield (0.8 and 0.5, respectively at a Co dose of 3 Gy). The total MN count in BNC followed the same pattern of response as the fraction of BNC with MN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
