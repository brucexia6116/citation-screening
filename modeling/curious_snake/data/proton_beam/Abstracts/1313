Daily, monthly, and annual quality control (QC) of linear accelerators are part of the major tasks of the medical physicist to verify that patients are receiving proper radiation treatment. The control tests consist of the measurement of beam output, verification of the beam energy, and determination of the beam flatness and symmetry in a linear accelerator. A new device, referred to as QC phantom, was designed and fabricated for the QC of linear accelerators. This device is accompanied by software generating the reports of all measured data, keeping track of day-to-day data, and plotting the results. The accuracy, reproducibility, and linearity of the QC phantom were evaluated in this project. Also, the user friendliness of this device for morning warmup of linear accelerators was tested
