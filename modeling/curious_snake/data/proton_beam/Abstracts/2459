Measurements have been performed of build-up and depth-dose characteristics of photon beams under Hodgkin's disease treatment conditions as applied in two hospitals (AVL, Amsterdam and IGR, Villejuif). Although different types of accelerators, photon energies, field sizes and SSD are employed, similar dose distributions along the beam axis have been obtained in both centers. In order to explain this unexpected good agreement, the influence of the geometrical conditions of irradiation on the build-up and depth-dose distribution has been studied in detail for five photon beams (8 MV-25 MV) of three types of accelerators
