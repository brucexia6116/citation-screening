Microdosimetric investigations were performed in a solid TE phantom at the DT-neutron generator at Hamburg-Eppendorf. Event size spectra were measured at different depths on the axis of a 10 X 10 cm2 field and at different lateral positions at a constant depth. Additionally, the microdosimetric spectrum of a 60Co source was determined. From radiobiological measurements the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of crypt stem cells of mice was estimated as a function of lineal energy. The measured microdosimetric spectra are folded with this RBE function so that RBE values at different positions in the phantom were obtained. The predicted change of the RBE inside and outside the useful beam of a 10 X 10 cm2 field is shown. Contributions to the RBE dose from the various charged particle components are analyzed separately
