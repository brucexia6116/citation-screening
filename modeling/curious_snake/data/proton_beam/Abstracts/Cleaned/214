passively scattered proton radiotherapy clinically useful treatment beam produced spreading small proton pencil beam extracted accelerator create uniform dose profile laterally uniform bragg peak sobp depth lateral spreading range modulation beam accomplished using specially designed components treatment delivery nozzle purpose study determine changes size initial proton pencil beam affect delivery dose passive scatter treatment nozzle monte carlo calculations used study changes beams energy distribution exit nozzle central axis depth dose profiles water resulting changes incident beam size results indicate width delivered sobp decreases size initial beam increases spread air
