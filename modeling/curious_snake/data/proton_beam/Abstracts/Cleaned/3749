modern curative radiotherapy requires higher doses tumor volume necessarily minimal doses surrounding normal tissues attempts use heavy charged particles achieve optimization currently investigation centers data indicate static superimposed magnetic field clinical beam offers capability tailoring isodose distributions furthermore variable superimposed magnetic field minimizes dose heterogeneities inherent beams suggest magnetically modified clinically available electron beams offer practical expensive means achieving tailored isodose distributions electron therapy tissue generated charged particle heterogeneity corrected
