radiation therapy imrt allows dose concentrated tumor volume sparing normal tissues downside imrt potential increase number second cancers reasons potential monitor units larger dose leakage radiation imrt involves fields bigger volume normal tissue exposed lower radiation doses radiation therapy double incidence solid cancers survivors outcome acceptable older patients balanced improvement local tumor control reduced acute toxicity hand incidence second cancers higher children doubling acceptable imrt represents special case children reasons children sensitive cancer adults second radiation scattered treatment volume important small body child question genetic susceptibility arises childhood cancers involve germline mutation levels leakage radiation current linacs inevitable leakage reduced substantial cost alternative strategy replace protons change advantage proton machine employs pencil scanning beam proton facilities use passive modulation produce field sufficient size use scattering foil produces neutrons results effective dose patient higher characteristic imrt benefit protons achieved scanning beam used doses NUMBER times lower imrt references NUMBER intensity modulated radiation induced total body intensity modulated long term radiation induced x rays
