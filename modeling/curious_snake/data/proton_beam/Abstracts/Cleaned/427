paper describes method 4d imaging used study respiratory organ motion key problem various treatments whilst commonly used imaging methods rely simplified breathing patterns acquire breathing cycle proposed method developed study irregularities organ motion free breathing tens minutes method does assume constant breathing depth strict periodicity does depend external respiratory signal 3d image sequences reconstructed retrospective stacking dynamic 2d images using internal sorting generic method demonstrated liver lung quantitative evaluations volume consistency advantages measurements image sorting dense deformation fields describing respiratory motion estimated reconstructed volumes using 3d registration obtained motion fields showed variations range minutes drifts deformations changed exhalation position liver breathing pattern obtained motion data used proton therapy planning evaluate dose delivery methodologies respect motion sensitivity application new possibilities studying respiratory motion valuable applications evaluation gating techniques respect residual motion time resolved image based dimensional non rigid
