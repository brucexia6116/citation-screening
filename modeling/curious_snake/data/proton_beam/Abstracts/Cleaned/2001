characteristic bragg peak protons heavy ions provides good localization dose dimensions ability deliver laterally distally shaped homogenous fields protons shown precise practical method delivering highly conformal radiotherapy analogous manner intensity modulation photons protons used construct dose distributions application individually inhomogeneous fields localization dose bragg peak providing possibility modulating intensity field dimensions different methods intensity modulation protons implemented existing proton planning preliminary evaluation efficacy methods applied example case using variety field combinations histogram analysis resulting dose distributions shows large numbers fields used techniques exhibit good target homogeneity sparing neighbouring critical structures little difference techniques discerned number fields decreased 3d modulation individual bragg peaks preserve target coverage sparing normal tissues conclude 3d method provides greatest flexibility constructing conformal doses challenging situations large numbers beam ports available little advantage gained additional modulation intensity depth dose volume
