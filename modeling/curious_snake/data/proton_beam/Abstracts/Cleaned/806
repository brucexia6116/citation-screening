present conceptually novel principle 3d reconstruction prostate seed implants unlike existing methods implant reconstruction proposed algorithm uses raw ct data sinograms instead reconstructed ct slices using raw ct data solves inevitable problems related reconstruction ct slices sinograms affected reconstruction artifacts presence metallic objects seeds patient body second scanning axis undersampled case ct slices matter fact scanning axis densely sampled seed typically represented samples shape single seed sinogram modeled exactly facilitating detection allows accurate 3d reconstruction position orientation seeds preliminary results indicate seed position estimated NUMBER mm accuracy average orientation estimate accuracy NUMBER deg average main contribution paper present new principle reconstruction preliminary implementation presented proof concept implemented algorithm tested phantom obtained results presented validate proposed approach
