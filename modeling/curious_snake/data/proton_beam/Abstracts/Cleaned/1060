geometric leaf placement strategies multileaf collimators mlcs typically involve expansion contour target uniform mlc margin followed movement leaves point leaf end touches expanded contour dosedistribution measurements determine appropriate mlc index multileaves set using particular strategy straight lines lying various angles direction leaf travel simple trigonometric relationships exist different geometric leaf placement strategies used generalize results film work d90 values different strategies measured d90 values vary angle leaf placement strategy model derived explains describes quite observed variations d90 angle d90 angular variations strategies studied differ substantially geometric dosimetric reasoning suggests best strategy angular variation using criterion best straightforwardly implementable strategy studied touch circle approach semicircles imagined inscribed leaf ends leaves moved semicircles just touch expanded target outline beams eye view film based margins characterized d90
