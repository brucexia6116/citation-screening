present paper experimental results radiobiological investigations sedimentation behaviour damaged restored attached nuclear membrane summarized studies carried preferably chinese hamster cells irradiated different kinds radiation neutrons carbon ions using nucleoid sedimentation technique breaks relax supercoiled dna subunits resulting decreased sedimentation velocity rejoining leads correct restoration structure studied means postincubation irradiation breaks release dna fragments leading increased sedimentation velocity average number induced breaks subunit increases number higher measured results suggest structures restored completely results compatible new repair model developed laboratory assumption firstly single dna subunits sensitive target dna secondly repair dna damage takes place independently subunit dna subunits v79 NUMBER gamma rays single strand double strand double strand
