respiratory organ motion key problem proton therapy treatments paper presents novel retrospective gating method 4d dynamic 3d mr imaging free breathing capture variability respiratory organ deformation contrast imaging methods constant breathing depth strict periodicity assumed 3d images moving organs reconstructed complete respiratory cycles retrospective stacking dynamic 2d images using internal gating additional noise reduction combining multiple images significantly increases ratio resulting image quality comparable acquisitions method developed proton therapy planning new possibilities study respiratory motion valuable improve treatments assess gating techniques rely stronger assumptions breathing pattern image based signal noise breath hold
