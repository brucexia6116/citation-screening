proton beam therapy developed years reasonable treatment techniques cancer therapy based beneficial features proton beams favorable clinical results obtained progress form treatment expected fundamental clinical features technique future plans studied moment discussed based clinical results obtained mainly particle radiation medical science center tsukuba university fundamental features proton beam possibility selective irradiation tumor lesion minimal irradiation surrounding normal tissues fine dose distribution favorable biological response similar 60co gamma rays beneficial features proton beams tumor lesions successfully irradiated sufficiently large doses avoiding irradiation important organs close lesions treatment results revealed sufficient control lesions resistant conventional radiotherapy locally advanced lesions lesions large volume low sensitivity results suggested proton beam therapy applied radical treatment lesions wider indication range especially organs compared conventional radiotherapy investigations proton beam treatment continued development techniques delives precisely controlled irradiation lesions moving organs treatment unit installable cancer hospitals deep seated
