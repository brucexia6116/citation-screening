purpose craniospinal irradiation poses technical difficulties addressed use newer technologies available past decade use ct simulation allows improved target localisation beam geometry definition significantly reducing treatment simulation time developed technique cns irradiation supine position uses fixed field parameters asymmetric jaws field matching drastically reduces simulation treatment times methods patient ct scanned treated supine position clinical target volume relevant critical structures outlined planning ct scan half beam blocked lateral fields collimator rotation used match beam divergence superior border spinal field c2 vertebral body shielding cranial fields generated automatically dose distribution calculated using 3d treatment planning fixed field parameters used planning treatment position isocenter spine field fixed longitudinal distance isocenter brain fields multiple posterior fields required isocenter second spine field fixed longitudinal distance gap fields determined using virtual simulation feathered treatment using asymmetric jaws linear accelerator treatment portals filmed daily week treatment junction change results conclusion supine position provides numerous advantages patients comfortable treatment position reproducible access airway possible necessary patient sedation use ct simulation decreases simulation time allows increased planning accuracy enables use multimodality image registration 3d treatment planning use asymmetric jaws allows junction feathering changing patient setup using couch angle ct based
