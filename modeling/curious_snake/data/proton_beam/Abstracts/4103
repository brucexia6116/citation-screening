Patient treatments at TRIUMF (Tri-University Meson Facility, Vancouver, B. C.) use a moving spot raster scan technique where the pion range is modulated in depth for each position of the moving spot. The spot scans in a stepwise fashion and can produce any desired field shape. This approach provides very good dose uniformity across the treatment field and allows maximum flexibility in shaping the treatment volume. Survival of cultured cells has been used as a biological dosimeter to test the isoeffectiveness of the pion dose distributions, which must be shaped in depth to compensate for the depth-dependent LET distribution. Isoeffectiveness across the treatment field has also been verified using this system, which involves irradiating cells supported in a gelatin matrix. The response of pig skin to pion irradiation at TRIUMF has provided a check on the in vivo RBE for acute effects derived from our earlier studies with mouse foot. In addition, the pig skin reactions have been followed for several months to assess the later dermal response. The RBE of our pion beam relative to 270 kVp X rays is approximately 1.5 for both the acute epidermal and the later dermal responses
