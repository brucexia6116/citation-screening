An ultra high energy neutron facility was constructed at PARMS, University of Tsukuba, to produce a neutron beam superior to an X-ray beam generated by a modern linac in terms of dose distribution. This has been achieved using the reaction on a thick uranium target struck by 500 MeV proton beam from the booster-synchrotron of High Energy Physics Laboratory. The percentage depth dose of this neutron beam is nearly equivalent to that of X-rays at around 20 MV and the dose rate of 15 cGy per minute. Relative biological effectiveness of this neutron beam has been estimated on the cell killing effect by the use of HMV-I cell line. Resultant survival curve of cells after the neutron irradiation shows the shoulder with n and Dq of 8 and 2.3 Gy, respectively. RBE value at 10(-2) survival level for the present neutron, compared with 137Cs gamma-rays is 1.24. The result suggests that the biological effects of high energy neutrons are not practically large enough whenever the depth dose distribution of neutrons becomes superior to high energy linac X-rays
