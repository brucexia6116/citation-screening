This paper describes the irradiation of thin samples of blood with 8.7 MeV protons and 23.5 MeV helium-3 ions in the track segment mode. Chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes have been scored. The relationship between dicentric yield and dose in Gy was Y = 0.044 D + 0.058 D2 for protons and Y = 0.394 D for helium ions. These results are compared with data from other laboratories using protons and an attempt is made to reconcile differences. An unexpected observation was that the ratio of the linear coefficients for helium ions and protons was about 9 whereas the ratio of the l.e.t. values was 4.5. This disagrees with current theory which predicts that the linear coefficients should be proportional to l.e.t. Possible sources of error in our experiments are discussed but do not adequately account for the discrepancies
