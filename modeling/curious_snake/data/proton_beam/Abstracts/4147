Three cell lines, human glioma U-343MG, Chinese hamster V79-379A and human colon carcinoma LS-174T, were analysed for clonogenic survival and with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis regarding induction and rejoining of double-strand breaks (dsb) in DNA. The cells were irradiated with either intermediate linear energy transfer (LET approximately 55 keV/microns) He ions or with 60Co photons and showed cell type-specific variations in their survival curves. The induction of dsb, per DNA unit, increased linearly with dose for both radiation qualities, and there were no cell type-dependent differences. However, the dsb induction frequency increased for all three cell lines with an RBE of 1.31 +/- 0.08 (SD) after He ion irradiation. All three cell lines showed biphasic dsb rejoining patterns with cell type-specific differences. The differences between the cell lines were somewhat smaller after irradiation with He ions, although the patterns were very similar to those seen after photon irradiation. The shoulders in the survival curves disappeared after He ion irradiations, however the cells retained the capacity to rejoin dsb. After 8-h rejoining the increase of LET to intermediate values did not give a higher fraction of residual dsb
