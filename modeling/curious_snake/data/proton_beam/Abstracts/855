Atomic Force Microscopy of phiX174 plasmids irradiated in vitro was used to visualise the DNA fragmentation induced by heavy ions and to compare it to the fragmentation pattern obtained after X-irradiation. Fragment distributions induced by low ion fuences were found to be much more shifted towards small fragment sizes than the distributions obtained after corresponding doses of X-rays. The average fragment length was found to be significantly smaller than the full plasmid length even for single ion traversals
