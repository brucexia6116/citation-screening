BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The radiologic assessment of suspicious brain lesions after stereotactic radiotherapy of brain tumors is difficult. The purpose of our study was to define parameters from single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy that provide a probability measure for differentiating neoplastic from radiation-induced, nonneoplastic lesions. METHODS: Seventy-two lesions in 56 patients were examined using a combined MR imaging and MR spectroscopy protocol (point-resolved spectroscopy, TE = 135 ms). Signal intensities of cholines, creatines, N-acetyl aspartate, and the presence of lactate and lipid resonances were correlated to final diagnoses established by clinical and MR imaging follow-up, positron emission tomography studies, or biopsy/surgery. Statistical analysis was performed using the t test, linear discriminant analysis, and k nearest-neighbor method. RESULTS: Significantly increased signal intensity ratios I(tCho)/I(tCr) (P <.0001) and I(tCho)/I(NAA) (P <.0001) were observed in neoplastic (n = 34) compared with nonneoplastic lesions (n = 32) and contralateral normal brain (n = 33). Analysis of I(tCho)/I(tCr) and I(tCho)/I(NAA) data yielded correct retrospective classification as neoplastic and nonneoplastic in 82% and 81% of the lesions, respectively. Neither I(NAA)/I(tCr) nor signal intensitities of lactate or lipids were useful for differential diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Metabolic information provided by proton MR spectroscopy is useful for the differentiation of neoplastic and nonneoplastic brain lesions after stereotactic radiotherapy of brain tumors
