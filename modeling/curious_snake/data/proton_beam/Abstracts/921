BACKGROUND: Dry eye symptoms can often be observed following vitreo-retinal operations, however, little is known about the frequency and severity of these postoperative problems. METHODS: Examination of 140 patients following vitreo-retinal surgery ( n=31), brachytherapy ( n=76), proton beam radiation ( n=33) and controls ( n=54) using a questionnaire together with a clinical examination of the anterior segment, tear break-up time and a Schirmer test. RESULTS: Of the treated patients 63% complained of dry eye symptoms versus 40% of the controls ( p=0.004). The tear break-up time was decreased in treated patients ( p<0.001, medians: 15 vs. 20 s). No significant difference was seen on the Schirmer test ( p=0.825; medians: 12 vs. 12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Dry eye symptoms are a common postoperative complication following vitreo-retinal surgery and ocular tumour therapy
