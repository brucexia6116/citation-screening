Long-term observations of mechanical parameters have been performed in Freiburg for the last 7 years within the quality assurance of stereotactic irradiation at linear accelerators. The deviations between the laser indication and the position of the beam isocentre are recorded, as well as parameters for the stability of the couch rotation and the additional devices for patient adjustment and beam collimation. The deviations are used for the correction of the calculated isocentre coordinates. The long-term observation of the measured values and their standard deviations allow conclusions about the quality of the measuring procedure itself, the laser adjustment, the extension of the isocentre sphere, as well as the mechanical slackness of the treatment couch and the fixation device of the stereotactic ring. The standard deviations of the isocentre position were within 0.3 to 0.8 mm, those of the measurement quality approximately 0.2 mm. The analysis of long-term observation has contributed to improvements of the equipment and of quality assurance procedures
