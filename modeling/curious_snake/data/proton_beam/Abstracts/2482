The paper discusses the results of five studies on 35 test subjects conducted to test diets of dehydrated products to be used in prolonged space flights. The studies have demonstrated that a diet consisting of only dehydrated food products can be used for a prolonged time (up to 1 year). Dehydrated foods after a 2-year storage and proton irradiation at a dose of 24,000 rad retain their biological value and assure an adequate nutritional status. On this basis a space diet composed of dehydrated foods has been developed
