PURPOSE: Most malignant meningiomas will recur following surgical resection only. The role of irradiation and radiation dose levels is poorly defined. This study reviews a single institution experience using both, conventional and high doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE radiation regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1995 16 patients with histologically proven malignant meningioma underwent radiation therapy (RT). Age at diagnosis ranged between 6 and 79 years (median: 49 years). Three patients reported previous irradiation to the head at least 14 years prior to diagnosis. Ten patients were treated for primary, and 6 patients for recurrent disease. Six patients underwent gross total and 10 patients subtotal resection (Table 1). RT was delivered using conventional, megavoltage photons or combined 160 MeV proton and photon irradiation. Except 1 patient, who died during RT, the radiation doses ranged between 40 and 70 Gy/CGE (= Cobalt Gray Equivalent) (median: 58 Gy/CGE, Table 2). RESULTS: With median observation time of 59 months (range: 10 to 155 months), actuarial local control rates at 5 and 8 years were 52% and 17%, respectively. Target doses > or = Gy/CGE resulted in significantly improved tumor control (100%) compared to < 60 Gy/CGE (17%) (p = 0.0006, Table 3 and Figure 1). Improved local control translated also in increased overall survival: 87% (> or = 60 Gy/CGE) versus 15% (< 60 Gy/CGE) at 5 years (p = 0.025, Figure 2). At time of analysis, 6/16 patients (38%) were alive. Two patients developed symptomatic brain damage at doses of 59.3 and 72 Gy/CGE. CONCLUSION: Conformal, radiation therapy with target doses > or = 60 Gy/CGE, in this study by use of combined proton and photon irradiation, can significantly improve chances of long-term local control and survival for patients diagnosed with these challenging tumors
