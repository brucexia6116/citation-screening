Stereotactic radiosurgery is a technique for treatment of intracranial lesions requiring high precision in all steps--from image acquisition to final irradiation. One of most difficult steps is the treatment planning phase, consisting of determination of irradiation parameters sufficient to cover the target volume by avoiding sensitive volumes. A manual and empirical definition can be very long and difficult, especially in the case of complex target volumes situated in sensitive zones. As in conventional radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery has taken advantages from dosimetric optimization. The question is: "What is the configuration of irradiation parameters used in order to obtain the treatment plan by satisfying defined constraints?". The purpose of this article is to summarize optimization methods used in radiosurgery and to describe the technical alternatives proposed for this treatment as well as the possibilities of plan evaluation between different techniques. This purpose will be illustrated by the optimization methodology used in the Center Oscar Lambret of Lille, France for the radiosurgical treatment with linear accelerator
