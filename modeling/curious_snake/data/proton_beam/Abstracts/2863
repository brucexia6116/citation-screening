Following the experience of the German authors, the treatment of choroidal melanoma with ruthenium 106 disk was introduced in Lyon. Between 1983 and 1988, 127 patients were treated. Results are analysed on a group of 84 patients followed 18 months and more. In 72 cases a reduction of thickness was noted. It was complete in 33 cases. Enucleation was performed in 10 patients due to no response or regrowth. In 3 cases the tumor was sterilized. Five patients died of metastases, and 73 are alive, 3 of them with liver metastases. An afterloading iridium template disk was used in 8 patients. 4 of them with a tumor thickness between 6.5 and 8 mm had a good response. Edema of the fovea was observed in 21% of cases, while cataracts were very unusual with Ru 106. An enucleation was performed in 6 patients because of a complication. A useful vision may be preserved in 60% of cases. The scleral tolerance dose is close to 1,500 Gy. These results are in agreement with those of the literature and are considered to be satisfactory for tumors not exceeding 5 to 6 mm in thickness. If the tumor is located close to the fovea or the papilla, and/or if the thickness is 8 mm or more, proton beam could be a good alternative
