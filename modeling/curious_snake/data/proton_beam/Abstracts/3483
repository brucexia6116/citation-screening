The proton beam of the 157 MeV synchrotron of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics was modified for irradiation of prostatic cancer patients. Patient's topometric preparation and method of transperineal irradiation were described. A method of radiotherapy with proton beam boost was applied to 17 patients with different clinical stages of disease. After 6-20 months of the follow-up all the patients have been alive without clinical signs of tumor. In most of the patients radiation reactions of the critical organs were regarded as mild ones. Chronic and long-term radiation injuries were not detected in the patients who lived over 1 year
