This study deals with 43 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of a maximum of 20 mm in diameter. All of them were radiosurgically treated with a linear accelerator in stereotatic conditions (UMIC). The delivered doses vary from 20 gys to 50 gys. Thirty-seven were controlled angiographically and 35 of them showed the disappearence of the AVM. Different parameters can modify the results: delivered dose, the size and shape of the lesion, target-volume, peripheral lesion isodosis (75%), location, underestimation of the size or dose. These results show that small lesions are best to treat than larger ones, particularly because their volume enables us to encompass them more easily. The uniformity of this series is related to the homogenous size of the treated AVMs, thus avoiding the discussion of global, unclear, results. [References: 55]
