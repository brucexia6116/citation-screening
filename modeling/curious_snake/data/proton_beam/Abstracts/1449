At the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Krakow (INP), in collaboration with the Centre of Oncology in Krakow, several types of miniature thermoluminescent LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P detectors specially designed for clinical dosimetry in radiotherapy have been developed. The detectors are manufactured in the form of solid pellets of diameter down to 1 mm and typical thickness 0.5 mm, in the form of rods with a diameter of 0.5 mm and a length of a few mm, and as two-layer detectors with a thin (in the range of 0.065 mm) active layer of high-sensitive LiF:Mg,Cu,P. All three types of newly developed detectors have already been applied in proton beam dosimetry, surface dosimetry of eye-plaque brachytherapy applicators, phantom dosimetry for vascular brachytherapy and in vivo dosimetry in interstitial brachytherapy. These detectors were found to be very useful for dose measurements in high dose gradients, where spatial resolution better than 1 mm is required
