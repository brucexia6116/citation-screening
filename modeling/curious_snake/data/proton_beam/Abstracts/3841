The values of regional mean concentrations of natural radionuclides in the teeth samples of the RSFSR residents vary within 130-203 mBk/kg for 238U, 174-490 mBk/kg for 226Ra, 1.8-3.4 Bk/kg for 210Pb, 26-56 mBk/kg for 232Th, 50-150 mBk/kg for 228Th. The mean values of 238U in osseous tissue and teeth are similar and equal 120 +/- 35 and 112 +/- 38 mBk/kg, respectively. Radioactive balance between 228Th and 232Th in osseous tissue is absent. The ratio of the concentration of 228Th/232Th is on the average equal to 2.4 +/- 0.9 and of 220Th/832Th doesn't exceed 1.3. The distribution of regional mean concentrations of radionuclides of uranium and thorium series complies with standard distribution. An annual effective equivalent internal dose obtained because of natural alpha-emitters has been calculated for the population of the RSFSR
