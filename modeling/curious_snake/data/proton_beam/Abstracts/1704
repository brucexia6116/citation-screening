PURPOSE: This retrospective analysis aims to report results of patients with cervix cancer treated by external beam radiotherapy (EBR) and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From September 1992 to December 1996, 138 patients with FIGO Stages II and III and mean age of 56 years were treated. Median EBR to the whole pelvis was 45 Gy in 25 fractions. Parametrial boost was performed in 93% of patients, with a median dose of 14.4 Gy. Brachytherapy with HDR was performed during EBR or following its completion with a dose of 24 Gy in four weekly fractions of 6 Gy to point A. Median overall treatment time was of 60 days. Patient age, tumor stage, and overall treatment time were variables analyzed for survival and local control. Cumulative biologic effective dose (BED) at rectal and bladder reference points were correlated with late complications in these organs and dose of EBR at parametrium was correlated with small bowel complications. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 38 months. Overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control at 5 years was 53.7%, 52.7%, and 62%, respectively. By multivariate and univariate analysis, overall treatment time up to 50 days was the only statistically significant adverse variable for overall survival (p = 0.003) and actuarial local control (p = 0.008). The 5-year actuarial incidence of rectal, bladder, and small bowel late complications was 16%, 11%, and 14%, respectively. Patients treated with cumulative BED at rectum points above 110 Gy(3) and at bladder point above 125 Gy(3) had a higher but not statistically significant 5-year actuarial rate of complications at these organs (18% vs. 12%, p = 0.49 and 17% vs. 9%, p = 0.20, respectively). Patients who received parametrial doses larger than 59 Gy had a higher 5-year actuarial rate of complications in the small bowel; however, this was not statistically significant (19% vs. 10%, p = 0.260). CONCLUSION: This series suggests that 45 Gy to the whole pelvis combined with four fractions of 6 Gy to point A with HDR brachytherapy is an effective and safe fractionation schedule in the treatment of Stages II and III cervix cancer if realized up to 50 days. To decrease the small bowel complications, we decreased the superior border of the parametrial fields to the S2-S3 level and the total dose to 54 Gy
