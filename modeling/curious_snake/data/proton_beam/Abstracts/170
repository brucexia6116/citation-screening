A method to characterize the energy distribution in the whole photon field is valuable when designing an accelerator for choosing target and flattening filter or scan pattern. Another field of application is beam characterization for treatment planning systems or other dosimetric purposes. This work is focused on the energy distribution in different 50 MV bremsstrahlung beams with different scanning of electrons on three different targets. Fluence differential in energy and angle at the exit of each target has been determined by Monte Carlo calculations for a narrow beam. Data for broad beams were obtained by convolution of the narrow beams with different scan patterns. Photon energy fluence differential in energy at SSD 100 were thus found to be rather different for the targets studied. The results are presented as mean energy profiles and narrow beam half-value layer (HVL) in water. Two different experimental setups were used to measure HVL at the central axis and at off-axis positions. The two methods gave results which differ by 5%-6% and the calculated data where within these experimental results. In conclusion, the presented method for characterization of the photon field energy distribution is well within the experimental results and can thus be used to improve accelerator design or dosimetric calculations, e.g., for treatment planning
