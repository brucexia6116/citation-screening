The ion beam therapy facility HICAT presently under construction at the Heidelberg University Clinic will be the first clinical irradiation facility for heavy ions in Europe. Its capacity should enable the treatment of 1000 patients per year. The use of different ion species ranging from protons to oxygen under identical conditions should clarify the question of which particle species is best suited in terms of indication. A synchrotron will accelerate the particles to energies corresponding to water-equivalent ranges from 2 cm to 30 cm. An intensity-controlled raster scanning technique will be used to optimize the use of the favorable depth dose distribution of ions. The planned heavy-ion gantry will be the first world-wide. The facility should be complete in 2006
