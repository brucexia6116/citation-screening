Chordomas are rare malignant neoplasms representing less than 3% of all primary bone tumors. They usually have a benign histological appearance and a slow growth rate. Their locoregional progression nearly always causes suffering and eventually death. Efforts to increase local control have included aggressive surgery, radiation therapy or combined approaches but locally free survival rates remain relatively low and have not exceeded 30% at 5 years. Sacrococcygeal chordomas, which represent approximately 50% of the localizations, have been investigated less frequently than those at the base of the skull or cervical region with primary or post-operative radiation therapy. The disappointing results with photon therapy in a multimodality approach and the good results reported by Schoenthaler with charged particles in the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory led us to propose fast neutron therapy in the management of inoperable or recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas. Preliminary results obtained from only 12 patients indicate that high linear energy transfer (LET) therapy seems to be a good alternative for radical treatment of chordomas in the case of microscopic or macroscopic residual tumor.
