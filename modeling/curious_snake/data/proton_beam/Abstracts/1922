At the Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay, nine children with intra-cranial malignancies were treated between July 1994 and January 1998. Immediate and late tolerances were excellent in all cases (follow-up 2 to 50 months). Two patients recurred locally (marginal failures), seven are alive and doing well. At Loma Linda, 28 children were treated between 1991 and 1994, 16 for a benign tumor of the brain and twelve for a malignant one. With a follow-up of seven to 49 months, three patients died (grade 2 to 4 gliomas), one is living with a persistent disease. Four children had treatment-related toxicity (one cataract, two hormonal failures and two seizures). The other children are doing well. At MGH Boston, 18 children with skull base-cervical spine chordomas have been reported. At five years, actuarial survival and disease-free survival have been 68 and 63%, respectively. Children with cervical sites had a worse prognosis (p = 0.008). Four children had radiation-related morbidity: two pituitary failures, one temporal lobe necrosis, one temporal muscle fibrosis. In this experience, such rare tumors seemed to behave in children like in adults
