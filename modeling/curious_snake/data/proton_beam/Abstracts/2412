The goal of this paper is to develop a relationship between a neutron RBE and neutron energy, En, which can be used to design neutron sources for BNCT. In an earlier calculation of a neutron RBE as a function of En, we approximated the contribution to a total neutron RBE, RBEt (En), arising from 14N(n,p)14C reactions. In this paper, we recalculate RBEt (En), accounting more exactly for the contribution to RBEt (En) from 14N(n,p)14C reactions
