Twenty patients with inoperable arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain were treated with neutron radiosurgery. A 50 MeV cyclotron was used to deliver 9 Gy in a single fraction through 7 to 14 isocentric portals. The size and shape of the portals were customized to each treatment site. Nineteen patients have been followed for a median duration of 24 months following neutron radiosurgery. A radiographically demonstrable partial response was seen in 8 patients (42%). No complete responses were observed. There has been one post-treatment hemorrhage, no fatalities, and no evidence of radiation toxicity. The low response rate and absence of toxicity suggest that the appropriate dose for neutron radiosurgical treatment of AVMs is higher than the dose of 9 Gy at isocenter used in this initial study
