Therapy of choroidal metastases depends on several factors, but conventional external beam irradiation using photons is the most common treatment. Proton beam irradiation has recently been used for selected lesions. The advantage of this method is that the dose can be localized to the tumor more accurately. Other therapies include chemotherapy, photocoagulation, or, in extreme cases, enucleation. The author discusses these treatment modalities, complications, and prospects for future therapies.
