Stereotactic radiosurgery with linear accelerator requires accurate localization of target and accurate spatial delivery of radiation. In phantom study, geometric accuracy of radiosurgery was assessed in combination of CT simulation system (CTSS), which had been developed in our institute, and linear accelerator with supplemental collimator. After determination of target and its isocenter with CTSS, phantom was placed on treatment table so that isocenter meet at the intersection of mechanical axes (gantry, turn table). Displacement of the isocenter from the center of the radiation field was 1 mm in average. It was concluded that this combination could be applied to radiosurgery
