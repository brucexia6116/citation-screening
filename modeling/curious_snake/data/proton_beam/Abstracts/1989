The difficulties in verification of electron fields are due to the limited range of electrons within the human body. Modern linacs provide a special mode of operation (film mode), so that electron fields can be irradiated with a small photon dose. Thus, the images obtained can be used for comparison with the corresponding simulator images or DRRs to determine the electron field position and to detect positioning errors
