THE AIM of this study was to estimate the value of HMRS in the diagnosis of brain lesions observed in children treated with chemo and radiotherapy and to assess the possibility to differentiate these lesions from neoplasm or recurrent disease. MATERIALS AND METHOD: We examined 6 children, aged from 7 to 15 yrs, 3 with brain tumours, 1 with esthesioneuroblastoma treated with chemo and radiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy only, for other neoplasms (leukemia, Wilms tumor). Indications to perform imaging studies were routine for brain tumour patients (no clinical symptoms) and suspicion of disease recurrence in others. MR with 1.5 T scanner and additionally single voxel HMRS in PRESS sequence were performed. RESULTS: In all cases MRI showed extensive hyperintensive changes in brain tissue with significant mass effect. In 3 cases HMRS was within normal limits, in other 3 cases moderately elevated peak of choline and peak of lactate and lipids were found. In follow up examinations all lesions regressed and all patients are in good clinical condition. COMMENTS: It could be difficult to differentiate white matter injury from malignancies on MRI. HMRS in case of doubtful findings on MRI in children treated with chemo and radiotherapy, especially in those without symptoms of their disease, is a helpful method
