Primary tumor control remains a major problem in the treatment of locally advanced prostate carcinoma. Clinical local failure rates approach 30-40% and may be significantly higher when results of prostatic biopsy or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are considered. The low growth rate and cycling fraction of prostate adenocarcinoma suggest potential therapeutic advantage for the high linear energy transfer (LET) of neutrons. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) performed a multi-institutional randomized trial (RTOG 77-04) comparing mixed beam (neutron plus photon) irradiation to conventional photon irradiation for the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer. A subsequent trial by the Neutron Therapy Collaborative Working Group (NTCWG 85-23) compared pure neutron irradiation to standard photon irradiation. Both randomized trials demonstrate significant improvement in locoregional control with neutron irradiation compared to conventional photon irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate carcinoma. To date, only the mixed beam trial has shown a significant survival benefit. Future analysis of the larger NTCWG trial at the 10-year point should confirm whether or not improved locoregional control translates into a survival advantage. These findings have significant implications for all local treatment strategies including dose-escalated conformal photon irradiation, prostate implantation, and neutron radiation. Given the large numbers of patients afflicted with this disease, a positive survival advantage for neutrons or mixed beam therapy would provide a strong incentive for the development of economically feasible clinical neutron facilities.
