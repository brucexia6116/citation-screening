A treatment procedure that results in a uniform dose in a single fraction over the entire treatment volume while minimizing the dose to other tissues has been developed to treat intracranial lesions such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This technique is called dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery. Its main characteristic is simultaneous and continuous gantry and couch motion during the treatment procedure. It employs an isocentrically mounted linear accelerator as the source of radiation. Target localization is determined by digital subtraction angiography and CT. From results obtained in other centres, this technique has shown that an AVM less than 2.5 cm in diameter has an 85% chance of being completely obliterated within two years after a single treatment of stereotactic radiosurgery. This technique is suitable for those patients with inoperable, surgically inaccessible lesions, or whose current medical profile shows them to be high-risk candidates for surgical intervention
