BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: There is few report on the xerostomia of the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. Xerostomia is a serious, permanent, and ubiquitous sequelae in the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. It has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. This study was designed to investigate the severity of xerostomia and its impact on the quality of life in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, treated by conventional radiation therapy in Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, were surveyed by interview at the outpatient. A questionnaire and a visual analog scale (VAS) were used in analysis of xerostomia and xerostomia-related problems. RESULTS: Of 136 patents, 73.5% of the patients experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. 82.4% of the patients had to sip water to facilitate speech; 92.6% of the patients had to sip water to facilitate chewing and swallowing; 91.2% of the patients changed their feeding pattern (can eat only mashed food); 61.3% of the patients had to wake up to drink water because of dry mouth; 75.0% of the patients had teeth deteriorated. CONCLUSION: 73.5% of the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after conventional radiation therapy experienced a moderate to severe degree of xerostomia. Xerostomia has a significant impact on the patient's speech, deglutition, sleep, and increases the morbidity rate of the tooth
