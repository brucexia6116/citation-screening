The purpose of this study was to explore the potential advantages of using strong magnetic fields to increase tumor dose and to decrease normal tissue dose in radiation therapy. Strong magnetic fields are capable of altering the trajectories of charged particles. A magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the X-ray beam forces the secondary electrons and positrons to spiral and produces a dose peak. The same magnetic field also prevents the electrons and positrons from traveling downstream and produces a lower dose region distal to the dose peak. The locations of these high- and low-dose regions are potentially adjustable to enhance the dose to the target volume and decrease the dose to normal tissues. We studied this effect using the Monte Carlo simulation technique. The EGS4 code was used to simulate the effect produced by a coil magnet currently under construction. The coil magnet is designed to support up to 350 A operating current and 15 T peak field on windings. Dose calculations in a water phantom show that the transverse magnetic field produces significant dose effects along the beam direction of radiation therapy X-rays. Depending on the beam orientation, the radiation dose at different depths along the beam can be increased or reduced. This dose effect varies with photon energy, field size, magnetic field strength, and relative magnet/beam geometry. The off-axis beam profiles also show considerable skewness under the influence of the magnetic field. The magnetic field-induced dose shift may result in high dose regions outside the geometrical boundary of the initial radiation beam. We have demonstrated that current or near-term magnet technology is capable of producing significant dose enhancement and reduction in radiation therapy photon beams. This technology should be further developed to improve our ability to deliver higher doses to the tumor and lower doses to normal tissues in radiation therapy. Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc
