Following transurethral resection of the tumours, 86 patients with urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder were subjected to field irradiation treatment (6000 R). Percutaneous high-voltage therapy with cobalt 60 was given to 51 patients and 35 patients were exposed to ultra-hard X-rays from al 17 MeV betatron. Taking into account tumour staging and grading, there was no difference between the two groups as far as prevention of tumour recurrence is concerned. Tumour recurrences occurred in 63-65 percent of the cases. Following betatron irradiation, there was an average five-year survival rate of 54 percent, following telecobalt irradiation, the figure was 41 percent
