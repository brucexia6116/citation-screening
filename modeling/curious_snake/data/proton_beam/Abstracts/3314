Altogether 10 patients with spontaneous arteriosinusal anastomoses in the cavernous sinus area have been irradiated at the N. N. Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery, USSR AMS. since 1983 using the synchrotron of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. A "piercing" method with a proton beam of 12 mm in diameter (in one case 10 mm) was employed. Nine patients had unilateral anastomoses with the blood supply from branches of the internal and/or external carotid arteries, and one patient had a bilateral anastomosis. Irradiation was given in 2 fractions, in 2-3 days, the maximum total dose was 50-60 Gy. Regression of ophthalmological symptoms was noted 2-3 months after irradiation. Convalescence was noted in 8 patients, a follow-up period in 2 patients was insufficient. Of 7 patients examined by angiography complete thrombosis of the anastomosis was noted in 4, considerable reduction of the blood flow was noted in 3
