To elucidate p53-dependency on combined treatment with radiation and hyperthermia, growth inhibition and apoptosis were analysed using transplantable human tumour. Human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells carrying different p53 genes were transplanted into the thigh of nude mice. When the mean diameter of tumour reached 5-6 mm, the tumours were exposed to X-rays (2 Gy) or Carbon-ion (C-) beams (1 Gy) followed by heating at 42 degrees C for 20 min. Tumour growth inhibition was evaluated by measuring the diameters of tumour. The induction of apoptosis and accumulation of apoptosis-related proteins were also analysed by immunohistochemical staining. Synergistic enhancement of tumour growth inhibition by hyperthermia was observed in wild-type p53 tumours treated with X-rays or C-beams but not in mutant p53 tumours. The incidence of apoptotic cells and activated-caspase-3-positive cells after combined treatment with them were significantly high in wild-type p53 tumours compared with that in mutant p53 tumours. The hyperthermic enhancement of tumour growth inhibition by X-ray- or C-beam-irradiation was p53-dependent, suggesting that it might be highly correlated with p53-dependent apoptosis
