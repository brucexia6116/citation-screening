PURPOSE: To present technical considerations and results of proton irradiation in a single fraction for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with uncontrollable ascites. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites underwent proton irradiation of 24 Gy in a single fraction. Hepatic tumors were solitary in two patients, and multiple in one, and tumor sizes were 30, 30, and 33 mm in maximum diameter. No patient had lymph node or distant metastases. The center position of radiation fields was determined and the beam range was adjusted, using CT data taken immediately before irradiation to compensate for changes in the volume of ascites. Adjustment of the beam range was within 6 mm in water-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: All irradiated tumors showed objective responses, and were controlled during the follow-up period. Of the three patients, two were alive with no evidence of disease at 13 and 30 months, respectively, after treatment. The remaining patient died of ruptured esophageal varices 6 months after treatment. No therapy-related toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton beams were successfully adjusted immediately before irradiation. Single-dose irradiation with precisely adjusted proton beams may be tolerable for HCC patients with uncontrollable ascites
