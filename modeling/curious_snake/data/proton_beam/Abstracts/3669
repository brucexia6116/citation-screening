Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is thought to be more sensitive to radiation damage of the brain than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We presented performed 1H-MRS using the stimulated echo acquisition method (STEAM) for non-tumor sites in 2 patients who received radiation therapy for their brain tumors. In the first case up to 45 days after radiation, we could observe a normal spectra presented three major peaks of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), and choline (Cho). In the second case who had radiation necrosis 1 year after radiation, the spectra showed a decrease in the all peaks beneath the noise level
