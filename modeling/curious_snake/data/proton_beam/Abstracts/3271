The use of beam data for open photon fields when calculating absorbed dose distributions for beams with wedge filters has been studied. The depth doses for beams with wedge filters are changed through beam hardening and the dose maximum can be shifted; both these changes result in errors in the final dose calculations of several per cent if open beam data are used. The errors are larger for 6 MV than for 18 MV x-rays. The depth of measurement for determining the wedge factor and the influence of other beam modifying devices are discussed. It is recommended that the reference depth be used instead of the dose maximum for these kinds of measurements since the influence of contaminating electrons in the beam will then be avoided and the wedge factor will be correct at a clinically relevant depth
