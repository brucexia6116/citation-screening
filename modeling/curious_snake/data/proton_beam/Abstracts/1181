PURPOSE: Radiotherapy is a curative treatment modality in the early stages of follicle centre lymphoma. Survival rates, patterns of failure and prognostic factors were evaluated in a retrospective analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 116 patients with follicle centre lymphoma stage I and II were treated between 1970 and 1999 in Dresden. Therapy modalities were radiotherapy alone (103 patients) or combined radiotherapy/chemotherapy (13 patients). Radiotherapy was applied as involved-field-(IFI)- (104 patients), extended-field- (nine patients) or total-nodal- (three patients) irradiation. Patients received doses between 25 Gy and 50 Gy (median 35 Gy). RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year actuarial overall survival rates were 76% and 51%. Relapse free survival was 62% and 48% respectively. The median follow-up was 4,0 years. Relapses after complete remission were registered in 44 cases. Six patients have had in-field-recurrences. The majority of out-field-recurrences were nodal relapses (50%). 11% of relapses occurred outside of lymph nodes or were disseminated failures (18%). Significant favorable prognostic factors identified by multivariate and univariate analysis were low age (age < 50 years vs. age > 50 years), low stage and performance of bipedal lymphangiography as primary staging procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is an effective and tolerable treatment modality for follicle centre lymphoma in the early stages I and II. We registered a high proportion of nodal recurrences, which may be minimized by prophylactic extended radiotherapy
