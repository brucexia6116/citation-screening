The observation of chromosomal aberrations in circulating lymphocytes is the most sensitive biological indicator of human exposure to ionising radiation. Data at low doses from in vivo and in vitro irradiated lymphocytes are reviewed. Statistical uncertainties mean that no resolution can be made between a linear or threshold response in the range 0-20 mGy of low LET radiation. Above 20 mGy the data conform to the linear quadratic model. The possibility of measuring chromosomal aberrations for dose estimation, to be used in conjunction with epidemiological studies on groups of persons exposed to radiation from the Chernobyl accident, is discussed.
