Studies were made to evaluate the role of radiations in the treatment of carcinoma of the esophagus to confirm indications for charged particles. Results of the studies showed that prognosis of the patients treated with radiations depend strongly on length of tumor as well as on invasion of tumor cells into the adventitia of the esophagus. It was concluded that patients suffering from carcinoma of the esophagus less than 8 cm length are indicated for particle radiations
