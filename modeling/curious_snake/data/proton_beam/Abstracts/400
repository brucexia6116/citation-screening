Viability of human HTB140 melanoma cells after being exposed to fotemustine (FM) and dacarbazine (DTIC) as well as to proton irradiation was studied. Effects of 100 and 250 microM drugs were assessed after incubation of 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Irradiations were performed with 62 MeV therapeutic protons, delivering to the cell monolayer single doses of 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 Gy. Viability was evaluated 7 days after irradiation. Inactivation level was estimated using microtetrasolium (MTT) and sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays. Combined effects of each drug and protons, were carried out using the same drug concentrations. Proton doses applied were those used in therapy, that is, 12 and 16 Gy. With the increase of drug concentration or irradiation dose, level of cell inactivation reached approximately 60%, 48 h after drug treatment or 7 days after irradiation at 16 Gy. Considering the rate of drug concentrations used, as well as the level of doses applied, it appears that HTB140 cells are more resistant to proton irradiation than to alkylating agents tested. The combined treatment with FM or DTIC and protons did not show significant changes of cell viability as compared to the effects of single agents. Since the time point for measuring cumulative effects of drug and irradiation was 48 h post irradiation, it seems that the obtained level of viability could be attributed primarily to the effects of drugs
