28 patients with locally advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck received neutron therapy and were randomized between two dose levels: 145 cGy n gamma x twelve fractions, three fractions per week (total 17.4 Gy n gamma). 155 cGy n gamma x twelve fractions, three fractions per week (total 18.6 Gy n gamma). Acute toxicity for skin, mucous membrane, salivary and subcutaneous tissues was graded using the EORTC/RTOG scoring system. Analysis indicates 17.4 Gy n gamma as "safe". A further twelve patients are to be assigned to the higher dose (18.6 Gy n gamma) before making a final dose selection
