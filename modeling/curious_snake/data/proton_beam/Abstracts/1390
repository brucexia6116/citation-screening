Stereotactic radiosurgery is an encouraging approach to deliver higher doses of radiation boost for malignant gliomas safely and precisely. The purpose of this study was to investigate the radiation response and histological changes of malignant astrocytic tumors after stereotactic linac radiosurgery (SLRS). We studied an autopsy case of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and two surgical cases with gross total removal of recurrent GBM and anaplastic astrocytoma transformed from fibrillary astrocytoma treated with SLRS. Destructive changes, such as the disappearance of viable cells, coagulation necrosis, and fibrinoid degeneration of vascular walls, were observed in the center of the target of SLRS, which showed histologically similar radiobiological reactions to well-known delayed central nervous system radiation necrosis caused by conventional radiotherapy. The region showing such radiation necrosis was within the area irradiated with approximately 15-20Gy or more by SLRS; however, dense viable tumor cells remained in the periphery that was irradiated with less than 15Gy. In a comparative immunohistochemical study of the tumors before and after SLRS, neither MIB-1 and p53 labeling indices nor immunoreactivity for GFAP represented any persistent tendencies. There were very few TUNEL-positive cells in either tumor before and after SLRS. These results showed that radiosurgery for malignant gliomas leads to earlier radiation necrosis than conventional radiation and that it is useful in eradicating tumor cells in the center of the target. However, some viable tumor cells may remain in the periphery irradiated with an insufficient dose for cell death and may be partly transformed in character by DNA damage due to radiation. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was suggested to characterize the radiation response in radiosurgery tumor targets for correlation with histological findings
