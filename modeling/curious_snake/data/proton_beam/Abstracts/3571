The brain was examined (on the basis of neurological and electroencephalographic findings) in 43 patients with hypophysis adenomas both before and at various intervals after a single exposure of the tumour to protons with an energy of 1,000 MeV. The irradiation was performed by the stereotaxic convergent method. The radiation dose absorbed by the tumour was 100 Gy. The local character of the proton action, absence of irreversible changes in the brain, temporary, transient changes on the part of the oculomotor nerves (25.5%) and temporal lobes (9.3%) are demonstrated. The objective remission of the disease was attained in 97.7% of the cases
