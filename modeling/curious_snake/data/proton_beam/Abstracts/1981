On modern linear accelerators patient set-up is often awkward due to the height of the isocentre. A second set of lateral lasers was mounted approximately 20 cm below the isocentre allowing patient positioning at an ergonomical height. A small randomised study involving 16 heavy patients treated for pelvic malignancies demonstrated that using the lower lasers for patient set-up is not only likely to reduce strain on staff but also speed up the set-up process
