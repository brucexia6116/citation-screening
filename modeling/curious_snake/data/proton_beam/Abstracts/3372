Certain fundamental dosimetrical parameters involving the applications of asymmetric jaws were investigated. The nominal accelerating potentials (NAPs) were found to decrease from 5.1 to 4.2 and from 18.0 to 13.4 for the 6 and 18 MV beams, respectively, as the off-axis distance (OAD) increases from 0.0 to 15.0 cm. The relative beam intensity increases from 1.00 to 1.07 at OAD of 15.0 cm for the 6 MV beam, and to 1.02 at OAD of 7.0 cm for the 18 MV beam. The percentage depth doses (PDDs) for half-blocked fields of 4 x 4 cm, 10 x 10 cm and 20 x 20 cm were found to deviate from those of corresponding symmetric fields by less than 2% down to the depth of 35.0 cm. The field size factor (FSF) for the asymmetric field from 4 x 4 cm to 20 x 20 cm deviates less than 1.0% from those of the corresponding symmetric fields. The equivalent square concept was found to be applicable to asymmetric fields within 1% error if the jaw exchange effect is taken into consideration. The measured point doses for half-blocked fields of 4 x 4 cm, 10 x 10 cm and 20 x 20 cm for both 6 and 18 MV were within 3% of the calculated dose based on a published dose calculation method which employs symmetric field beam parameters, such as field size factor (FSF), percentage depth dose (PDD), and off-axis correction factors (OAFs). The efficacy of this point dose calculation method is discussed
