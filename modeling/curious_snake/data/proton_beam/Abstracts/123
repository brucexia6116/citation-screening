Intensity modulation of electron beams is one step towards truly conformal therapy. This can be realized with the MM50 racetrack microtron that utilizes a scanning beam technique. By adjusting the scan pattern it is possible to obtain arbitrary fluence distributions. Since the monitor chambers in the treatment head are segmented in both x- and y-directions it is possible to verify the fluence distribution to the patient at any time during the treatment. Intensity modulated electron beams have been measured with film and a plane parallel chamber and compared with calculations. The calculations were based on a pencil beam method. An intensity distribution at the multileaf collimator (MLC) level was calculated by superposition of measured pencil beams over scan patterns. By convolving this distribution with a Gaussian pencil beam, which has propagated from the MLC to the isocentre, a fluence distribution at isocentre level was obtained. The agreement between calculations and measurements was within 2% in dose or 1 mm in distance in the penumbra zones. A standard set of intensity modulated electron beams has been developed. These beams have been implemented in a treatment planning system and are used for manual optimization. A clinical example (prostate) of such an application is presented and compared with a standard irradiation technique
