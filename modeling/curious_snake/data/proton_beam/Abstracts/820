Helical tomotherapy (HT) combines a rotating intensity modulated fan beam with integrated CT imaging for high precision radiotherapy. HT plans for 12 patients with small brain tumours were compared with five other radiotherapy techniques. Proton techniques gave overall the best results, while HT was shown to produce better target dose uniformity (average SD=1.3%) and kept irradiation of organs at risk as good as other photon methods
