Analytic models for calculation of scatter distributions from flattening filters in therapy photon beams are presented. It is shown that the amount of scatter with high atomic number filters can vary from 2% in 4-MV beams to 10% for 24-MV beams. The use of low atomic number filters can increase the amount of scatter by a factor of 2. The dependence on the opening angle of the primary collimator is quite large since a larger opening angle requires a thicker filter, which increases the scattered fraction of the filtered beam. The scatter makes the filter act as an extended source of extra-focal radiation. The source distribution for monomedia filters is shown to be almost triangular. Integration in the calculation-point's eye view over the visible part of the filter scatter source yields the scatter fraction of the total energy fluence incident upon the patient. The experimentally well-known "tilt" of dose profiles for asymmetrical fields is explained by the model. For complete modeling of head scatter distributions in treatment planning, the model presented must be combined with models also describing the scatter from the collimators, auxiliary modulators such as wedges and compensating filters, and collimator backscatter to the beam monitor
