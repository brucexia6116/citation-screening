Application of a single fraction of parallel opposed GRID beams as a means of increasing the efficiency of radiation delivery to deep-seated tumors has been investigated. This evaluation was performed by measurement of dosimetric characteristics of the GRID radiation field in parallel opposed and single beam geometry. The limitations of the parallel opposed technique in terms of field size and tumor thickness have been evaluated for the conditions of acceptable spatial modulation. The results of this investigation have demonstrated an increase in therapeutic advantage for the parallel opposed technique over the single beam method when treating a deep seated tumor
