A miniature tissue-equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) system has been developed to facilitate microdosimetric measurements in high-flux mixed fields. Counters with collecting volumes of 12.3 and 2.65 mm3 have been constructed using various tissue-equivalent wall materials, including those loaded with 10B for evaluation of the effects of the boron neutron capture reaction. These counters provide a measure of both the absorbed dose and associated radiation quality, allowing an assessment of the utility and relative effectiveness of various neutron radiotherapy techniques such as boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), boron neutron capture enhanced fast neutron therapy (BNCEFNT) and intensity modulated neutron radiotherapy (IMNRT). An evaluation of the physical parameters affecting the measured microdosimetric spectrum, the gas multiplication characteristics and the measurement of absorbed dose is presented. In addition, important aspects of the calibration and low energy extrapolation techniques for the microdosimetric spectrum are provided
