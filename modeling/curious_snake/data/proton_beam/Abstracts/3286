The paper presents follow-up results of narrow-beam proton therapy (1000 MeV) in 75 female patients suffering from prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas. Prolactin concentrations reduced both in macro- and microprolactinomas patients. The response was achieved in 96% of the cases in adenoma stages I-IIIa. Such results are superior to those reached with other treatment modalities. The efficacy of the above proton treatment can be raised by adjuvant use of chemotherapy
