At present, episcleral plaque brachytherapy and charged particle or photon irradiation are the most commonly employed methods in ocular and adnexal conservative treatments. In the near future, a different therapeutic approach to these malignancies could be represented by a new device based on electron beam emission. The equipment used consists of an electron accelerator originally developed for intraoperative radiotherapy, modified to fit ocular pathologies. Adequate collimators and an enhanced mechanical accuracy are required for this special practice. An operative planning for epibulbar, adnexal and intraocular tumors is described, discussing its rationale for possible applications. Experimental tests using phantoms and Gafchromic(R) films are in progress. As all conservative treatments, the main gaol of this activity is the maintenance of a good visual function
