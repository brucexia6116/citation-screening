The aim of the present study was to determine the radioprotective effects of endo- and exogenous SOD on the number of post-radiation chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes from irradiated samples of whole blood. Blood samples from 17 donors were irradiated with the dose of 1 Gy of neutron radiation or with 2 Gy of gamma radiation. Specific endogenous activity of SOD was assessed in lymphocytes from both irradiated and non-irradiated blood samples. Lymphocytes were then cultured in standard conditions with the application of PHA as a stimulator of cell divisions. The rate of chromosomal aberrations was determined in lymphocytes obtained from these cultures. Preliminary results revealed relatively low SOD activity in lymphocytes from normal (non-irradiated) blood samples, though it could vary among individuals from 1.19 to 8.81 U/mg of protein (in extreme cases the differences are even eight-fold). In further experiments, however, no relationship between the level of endogenous SOD activity and number of postradiation chromosomal aberrations was found (exposure of blood samples to the dose of 1 Gy of neutron high LET radiation
