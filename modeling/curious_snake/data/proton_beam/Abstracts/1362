Radiotherapy plays an important role in the management of children with cancer. The aim is to achieve local tumour control while minimizing long-term effects. In the treatment of tumours of the central nervous system (CNS) the most important long-term effects are neuropsychological. Elsewhere orthopaedic long-term effects may compromise function or be cosmetically harmful. Proton therapy has the potential for homogeneous irradiation of the target volume while reducing the magnitude and/or extent of the low dose area outside the target volume. This may be clinically relevant for long-term effects in children. Proton radiotherapy has an established role in the treatment of children with chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the base of skull. Planning studies have demonstrated the potential for improving the therapeutic ratio for radiotherapy for tumours of the central nervous system by achieving a uniform dose within the target volume while minimizing the severity of neuropsychological sequelae. Clinical experience of proton radiotherapy for children remains limited with potential areas for clinical research
