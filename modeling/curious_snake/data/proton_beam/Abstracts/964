The results of a recent study on the limiting uncertainties in the measurement of photon radiation dose with MOSFET dosimeters are reported. The statistical uncertainty in dose measurement from a single device has been measured before and after irradiation. The resulting increase in 1/f noise with radiation dose has been investigated via various analytical models. The limit of uncertainty in the ubiquitous linear trend of threshold voltage with dose has been measured and compared to two nonlinear models. Inter-device uncertainty has been investigated in a group of 40 devices, and preliminary evidence for kurtosis and skewness in the distributions for devices without external bias has been observed
