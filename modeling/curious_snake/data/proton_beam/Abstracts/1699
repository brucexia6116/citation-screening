Continuous depth dose measurements are generally performed in water phantoms. It is now possible to make continuous depth dose measurements in the solid PMMA phantom Plexitom, developed by our group and manufactured by PTW. The mechanical construction of this phantom allows the continuous movement of the ionisation chamber within the solid phantom. The Plexitom is light and very handy. It is very useful for quality assurance, especially to check the radiation quality of the linac
