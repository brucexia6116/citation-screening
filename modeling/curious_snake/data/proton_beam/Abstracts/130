Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and thermoluminescent detectors (TLD-700) were used for physical and biological verification of heavy ion treatment planning. Experiments were performed in a cylindrical water phantom, in some cases with lung and bone equivalent material in front of the target volume. The results confirm the possibility of using thermoluminescent detectors for a quantitative verification of dose distributions. CHO cells can be used at least for qualitative dose verification
