Clinical phase I/II studies have been performed at the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research (SIN) since February 1982. Fifty-two out of 249 patients accepted for pion treatment by the end of 1986 were treated for malignant glioma with high dose pion irradiation. A substantial influence of their radioresistance was expected from increased radiation quality due to the contribution of high LET particles from pion capture, and by the possibility of target volume shaping and dose distribution related to the dynamic spot-scan conformation technique. The patients' treatment followed a dose escalation program with total doses from 2720-3420 cGy, fraction sizes from 170 to 205 cGy (90% isodose, minimum target dose), and treatment times from 4 to 5 weeks. 12/52 patients received an accelerated treatment with 3280 cGy in 14-22 days. 49/52 patients are eligible: 3 with astrocytoma of clinical aggressive behaviour, 14 with anaplastic astrocytoma (median age 42 years), and 32 patients with glioblastoma (median age 52 years). 8/49 patients had total/subtotal tumour resection, 19 patients a stereotactic biopsy. The patients were divided into three groups according to total dose, and a fourth group which received the accelerated treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in the median survival rate between the four groups, which was 13 months for the non-glioblastoma patients and 9 months for the glioblastoma patients. No radiation necrosis and no demyelination was found in 17 patients (6 recraniotomies, 11 autopsies). In 10/17 patients, clearly identifiable tumour cells were not demonstrated. NMR findings showed the tumour-surrounding oedema mostly stimulated by tumour necrosis and tumour progression. From these findings, further dose escalation programs, together with a shaping of the target volume close to the tumour, are not contraindicated
