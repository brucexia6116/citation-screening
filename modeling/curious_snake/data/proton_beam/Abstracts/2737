Backscatter from the asymmetric collimators of a linac into the beam monitor chamber (BMC) has been investigated for two accelerators having different BMC configurations. The effect has been quantified as a function of field size and collimator jaw position for 6 and 18 MV beams. The results indicate a maximum 2.5% (6 MV) and 4% (18 MV) decrease in output in one case and a negligible effect in the other case. The experiments indicate that the difference can be attributed to the different construction of the BMC's for the two accelerators
