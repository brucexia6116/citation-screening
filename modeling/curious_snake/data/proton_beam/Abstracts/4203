The article deals with the therapy of cancer of the cervix with external 42 MeV betatron bremsstrahlung irradiation in combination with intracavitary applicated radium. The described irradiation technique using special shielding blocks extends the dose distribution till to the region of paraaortic nodes in an extended field. The extended irradiation field is used on the basis of lymphographic examination. In the region of pelvis minor, sufficiently uniform dose distribution is attained with lethal tumor effect. The dose variability with betatron or cobalt external irradiation was also studied
