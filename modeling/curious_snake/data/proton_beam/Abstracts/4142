Between July 1983 and July 1989, we treated 35 patients with surgically inaccessible, symptomatic angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs) using stereotactic heavy-charged-particle radiosurgery. AOVMs were located in the brainstem (19), thalamus or internal capsule (9), basal ganglia (3), deep cerebral hemisphere and motor area (3), or cerebellopontine angle (1). All patients presented with clinical and radiological evidence of previous hemorrhage, usually with multiple episodes of hemorrhage. Treatment volumes ranged from 80 to 15,200 mm3 and treatment doses from 7.7 to 34.6 Gy. Mean follow-up was 40 months, with 31 patients followed for at least 2 years. Clinical outcome was excellent in 46%, good in 34% and poor in 14%; 6% died. Twenty-seven patients in excellent and good condition prior to treatment remained stable or improved neurologically. Two patients initially in poor condition, who had previously received conventional radiotherapy, died at 9 and 14 months after treatment, respectively. Six patients experienced recurrent hemorrhage 2-60 months following treatment. Three of these patients made a complete recovery. Although a larger number of treated patients must be followed over longer periods of time, stereotactic heavy-particle radiotherapy may be a valuable treatment modality for surgically inaccessible intracranial AOVMs
