The field of radiation oncology has advanced exponentially since the discovery of X-rays just over 100 years ago. With the advent of three-dimensional treatment planning, the therapeutic index was increased by dose escalation and more accurate shielding of normal tissues. Now, even greater advances are under way with IMRT, image-guided radiation therapy, delineation and control of organ motion, and real-time imaging. Similarly, the use of particle therapies such as protons has the potential to effect even more accurate dose distributions. Clinical studies investigating these modalities will likely further increase the efficacy of radiation in years to come. [References: 68]
