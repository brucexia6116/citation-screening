Cytogenetical studies of cosmonauts' peripheral blood lymphocytes after space flights on MIR orbital station showed a statistically significant increase in the yields of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations. However, similar studies with in vitro irradiation of biological objects with accelerated charged particles are of great importance for elucidation of the nature of cytogenetical damage induced in vivo. It is also important to investigate the structure of cosmonatus' diseases over their life, in particular, lens opacities and oncological diseases. Thus, the purpose of the investigations planned is to study cytogenetical damage in blood lymphocytes from cosmonauts after space flights on the ISS in vivo, as well as in donor blood lymphocytes after in vitro exposure to accelerated charged particles. The tasks of the project are as follows: determination of the yields and types of chromosomal aberrations in cosmonauts' blood lymphocytes before and after space flights, comparative studies of biological effects induced in vitro by different types of ionizing radiation in human blood lymphocytes in ground experiments, assessment of cytogenetical risks, analysis of the structure of cosmonatus' diseases comparing with that of whole population, study of the mortality and frequency of cataracts and oncological diseases in cosmonauts. The results to be obtained will be used for setting of health norms applied to the influence of radiations of different types, and for elaboration of measures to reduce health risks from space flight factors
