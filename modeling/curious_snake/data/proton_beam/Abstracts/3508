Twenty-four patients with intracranial vascular malformations were examined before and after helium ion radiosurgical treatment with angiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Twenty patients had high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). After treatment 18 of 20 AVMs (90%) showed a significant reduction in size on angiograms or MR images. Eleven of 20 (55%) had complete resolution on angiograms or MR images, 35% had partial resolution, and 10% showed no size change. Before treatment, the size range of the AVMs was 0.86-383 cm3 (median, 21.7 cm3). Smaller AVMs (less than 8 cm3) were more likely to resolve completely than medium-sized AVMs (8-64 cm3) or larger AVMs (greater than 64 cm3). Four additional patients had slow-flow vascular malformations: One had a venous angioma; one, a probable cavernous hemangioma; and two, malformations that were not seen on angiograms. CT proved inaccurate in demonstrating the boundaries of the AVM after treatment because it showed persistent contrast enhancement even when the AVM was completely obliterated on angiograms. MR imaging and angiography were complementary in the evaluation of therapeutic results and should be the primary modalities in the examination of patients with AVMs
