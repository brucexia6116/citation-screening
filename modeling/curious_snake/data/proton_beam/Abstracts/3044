Two methods are shown here to determine the 50% depth ionization (d50) using buildup materials of different thickness placed on top of a five-chamber detector array. In the first method, two sets of different thickness buildup material are required to perform the check, one set for checking 6 and 9 MeV, while another set is used for 12, 16, and 20 MeV electron beam from a Varian Clinac 2100C. The second method only requires two data points to determine the d50 depth for each energy. The d50 depths determined were compared with the d50 depth obtained using a water phantom with ionization chamber measurements. The method is simple to use especially for departments that use a similar detector to perform quality assurance tests such as output/symmetry/flatness check
