Ionising rays are employed in percutaneous radiation of head and neck tumours. Radiation reduces cell division in the target tissue. The individual parameters of the radiation procedure are determined within the framework of the interdisciplinarily conceived treatment. Tumour control probability depends on tumour-specific factors and on the dosage as well as on the treatment period. The macroscopic and microscopic extend of the tumour area determines the target volume and dosage of the radiation. Conformal radiation is the standard procedure in primary radiation treatment. The anticipated side effects influence the therapy concept and the radiation parameters. Long-term aftercare of the tumour patient is imperative. [References: 13]
