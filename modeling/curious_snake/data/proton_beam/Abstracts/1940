The results of an updated Australian survey of external beam radiotherapy centres are presented. Most of the centres provided most of the requested information. The relative caseloads of various linear accelerator photon and electron beams have not changed significantly since the previous survey in 1995. The mean age of Australian LINACs is 7.1 years and that of other radiotherapy machines is 14.7 years. Every Australian radiotherapy centre participated in a special run of the IAEA/WHO TLD postal dose quality audit program, which was provided for Australian centres by the IAEA and WHO in May 1998. The dose quoted by the centres was in nearly every case within 1.5% of the dose assessed by the IAEA. This is within the combined standard uncertainty of the IAEA TLD service (1.8%). The results confirm the accuracy and precision of radiotherapy dosimetry in Australia and the adequate dissemination of the Australian standards from ARL (now ARPANSA) to the centres. The Australian standards have recently been shown to agree with those of other countries to within 0.25% by comparison with the BIPM
