In a randomized study 20 patients with non small cell lung cancer were treated for cure at a linear accelerator. Before, during and after treatment levels of immunoglobulins were measured. At the end of radiation therapy levels of IgA, IgG and IgM decreased. After therapy they increased slowly. 3 months after irradiation the average immunoglobulin levels showed a reduction of 16%. After substitution of immunoglobulins no decrease of the levels was seen. After substitution of immunoglobulins the Karnofsky index was significantly higher. Substituted patients showed a lower rate of radiation pneumonitis
