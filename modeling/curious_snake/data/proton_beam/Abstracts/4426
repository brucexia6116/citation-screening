Several methods for dose deposition of a given isodose distribution were developed by implementation of different techniques of accelerator use. Common to all of these methods is the time-dependent change of certain accelerator parameters during radiation treatment. The accelerators for which these methods can be used are equipped with independent collimator jaws, however, not with any kind of multileaf collimation. This method was designed to deposit a certain group of dose distributions that are restricted by a small number of constraints. The developed methods were implemented into a digitally controlled medical linear accelerator and the dosimetric results of such treatments were evaluated. Dose distributions with spatial dependencies in one and in two dimensions were deposited by movement of one X-ray jaw pair. Furthermore, a method for generation of a two-dimensional rotationally symmetric dose distribution was developed
