OBJECTIVE: The optimal treatment for primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the nasal cavity remains controversial. This study was to analyze the initial response rate of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and the influence of different treatment modalities on prognosis. METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2002, the clinical data of 129 patients with previously untreated nasal NHL were retrospectively reviewed with all lesions confirmed by pathology. 116 patients were morphologically diagnosed as having nasal NK/T cell lymphoma. The immunophenotype was available in 57 cases and 52 (91.2%) of them were confirmed as NK/T-cell lymphoma. According to the Ann Arbor Staging System, 102 patients had stage I(E), 22 stage II(E), and 5 stage IV(E) disease. Among the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) diseases, 22 patients received radiotherapy alone, 7 chemotherapy alone, and 95 combined modality therapy (CMT). Of these 95 patients treated with CMT, 45 patients were treated with radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, and 50 with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The primary treatment for stage IV(E) patients was chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy to the primary tumor. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) for all patients was 68.0% and 55.8%, respectively. It was 71.7% and 60.9% for stage I(E), and 70.6% and 47.0% for stage II(E), respectively (P > 0.05). The OS and DFS at the 5th year were 83.1% and 68.0% for patients who achieved complete response (CR), and 18.0% and 15.5% for those who did not, respectively (P = 0.000). Of the 124 patients with stage I(E) and II(E) disease, 67 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone (22 patients) or radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (45), whereas 57 were treated with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (50) or chemotherapy alone (7). The CR rate after radiotherapy was 74.7%, however, it was only 19.3% after chemotherapy (P = 0.000). Of the 46 patients with PR, SD or PD after chemotherapy, 42 still had locoreginally localized lesion and 31 of these patients achieved CR by following radiotherapy which revealed satisfactory results. For stage I(E) and II(E) disease, the 5-year OS and DFS were 76.0% and 65.0% for radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, and 74.4% and 56.2% for chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The difference was statistically not significant. However, 7 stage I(E) and II(E) patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, and 4 of them died of disease progression, with 1-year survival of 26.7%. CONCLUSION: The majority of Chinese patients with primary nasal NHL are NK/T cell in origin. The complete response rate by radiotherapy is much higher than that by chemotherapy. The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients with early stage nasal lymphoma. Radiotherapy is suggested as the primary treatment for stage I(E) and II(E) nasal NK/T cell lymphoma
