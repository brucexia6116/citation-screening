A group of Swedish oncologists and hospital physicists have estimated the number of patients in Sweden suitable for proton beam therapy. The estimations have been based on current statistics of tumour incidence, number of patients potentially eligible for radiation treatment, scientific support from clinical trials and model dose planning studies and knowledge of the dose-response relations of different tumours and normal tissues. Besides sarcomas of the base of skull, which are classical sites for proton beam therapy, it is estimated that about 40 patients yearly in Sweden with sarcomas at other sites are candidates for proton beam therapy. About 20 patients each with malignant lymphomas, chiefly in the mediastinum, and thymomas are also candidates to decrease doses to surrounding heart and lungs. [References: 39]
