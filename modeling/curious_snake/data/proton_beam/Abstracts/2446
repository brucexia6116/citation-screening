Radiotherapeutic computed tomography is a powerful technique to generate anatomical transversal tomograms of the patient in treatment position by using the therapy beam from the treatment unit. For this purpose the treatment unit has to be equipped with a detector array that can detect the beam transmitted through the patient and a computer that analyzes the data and performs the back projection. When the treatment unit uses scanned elementary photon beams, the only practical technique available for generating high quality high energy photon beams, the operation principle and, to some extent, the image quality is similar to that of a 3rd generation CT-scanner. The optimum choice of detection geometry and type of radiation detectors for radiotherapeutic computed tomography particularly at high photon energies are discussed indicating the merits of BGO (bismuthgermanate) or CWO (cadmiumtungstate) photodiod arrays. The first tomographic images of a thorax phantom at an acceleration potential of 50 MV using such detectors are presented. The image contrast is similar to that for 300 kV X rays mainly because the considerable influence of pair production at 50 MV. Line spread and modulation transfer functions are presented indicating a resolution of the order of two millimeters using a crystal thickness of 5 mm. The advantages with radiotherapeutic computed tomography, beside forming a new general communication channel between different diagnostic techniques, dose planning, and radiation delivery, are the elimination of position errors and the provision of exact attenuation data for dose planning
