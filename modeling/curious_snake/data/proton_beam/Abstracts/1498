BACKGROUND: Conformal stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy with linear accelerators and hole collimators yield a dose concentration in the target volume by rotation of the gantry. For small target volumes collimators with isocentre diameters of 4-45 mm are used. In this paper dosimetric measurements with a commercial high doped p-type silicon detector are demonstrated and compared to measurements with diamond detector and ionisation chamber. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The properties of the silicon detector SFD from Scanditronix were investigated with the radiation of a Gammatron S and a Varian 2100 CD at 6 MV. The results were compared with those of a calibrated ionisation chamber (0.3 cm3) and a diamond detector. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: At the beginning the reproductibility of the registered dose and dose rate and the temperature dependence of the Si-detector were investigated at the Gammatron S. For the comparison the absorbed dose was measured with the ionisation chamber in air. The sensitivity decreases slightly with dose and dose rate. After a period of several days without radiation again higher doses were registered. The temperature dependence causes deviations of 0.25%/K. The signal-to-noise ratio and the spatial resolution were investigated with the linear accelerator. The signal-to-noise ratio is clearly lower compared with that of the diamond detector, whereas the resolution is nearly the same. CONCLUSIONS: The Si-detector is qualified for dosimetry of very small fields because of the insignificant dose and dose rate dependence and in spite of some disadvantages regarding dosimetric properties compared with the diamond detector. The advantage is the availability and the cost. Measurement with ionisation chambers are not useful for collimator diameters below 20 mm
