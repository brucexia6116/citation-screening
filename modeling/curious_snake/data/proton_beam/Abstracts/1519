The Fast Micromethod is a novel quick and convenient microplate assay for determination of DNA single-strand breaks. This method measures the rate of unwinding of cellular DNA upon exposure to alkaline conditions using a fluorescent dye which preferentially binds to double-stranded DNA. Here we applied this method to determine the levels of DNA single-strand breaks in HeLa cells induced by y-irradiation deriving from fission isotopes and activation products at the TRIGA Mark II research reactor in Mainz. An increased strand scission factor (SSF) value, which is indicative for DNA damage, was found at doses of 1 Gy and higher. A similar increase in SSF value, which further increased in a dose-dependent manner, was found in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells after irradiation with 6 MV X-rays from a linear accelerator to give a total exposure of 0.5 to 10 Gy
