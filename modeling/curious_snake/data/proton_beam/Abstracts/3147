Eleven patients with obstructive jaundice from unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, metastatic porta hepatis adenopathy, or direct compression from a pancreatic malignancy were treated at the Stanford University Medical Center from 1978-1983 with an external drainage procedure followed by high-dose external-beam radiotherapy and by an intracavitary boost to the site of obstruction with Iridium192 (Ir192). A median dose of 5000 cGy was delivered with 4-6 Mv photons to the tumor bed and regional lymphatics in 9 patients, 1 patient received 2100 cGy to the liver in accelerated fractions because of extensive intrahepatic disease, and 1 patient received 7000 "equivalent" cGy to his pancreatic tumor bed and regional lymphatics with neon heavy particles. An Ir192 wire source later delivered a 3100-10,647 cGy boost to the site of biliary obstruction in each patient, for a mean combined dose of 10,202 cGy to a point 5 mm from the line source. Few acute complications were noted, but 3/11 patients (27%) subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from duodenitis or frank duodenal ulceration 4 weeks, 4 months, and 7.5 months following treatment. Eight patients died--5 with local recurrence +/- distant metastasis, 2 with sepsis, and 1 with widespread systemic metastasis. Autopsies revealed no evidence of biliary tree obstruction in 3/3 patients. Mean survival time from initial laparotomy and bypass was 16.1 months, and from radiotherapy completion was 8.3 months. Evolution of radiation treatment techniques for biliary obstruction in the literature is reviewed. High-dose external-beam therapy followed by high-dose Ir192 intracavitary boost is well tolerated and provides significant palliation. Survival of these aggressively managed patients approaches that of patients with primarily resectable tumors
