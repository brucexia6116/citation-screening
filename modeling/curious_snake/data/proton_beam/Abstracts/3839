It was shown that radiation effects in tumor cells treated with fast neutrons may be increased by the neutron capture reaction 10B(n, alpha)7Li. The classic approach for macroscopic dosimetry in fast-neutron therapy cannot be applied to the dose in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The effectiveness of BNCT in killing tumor cells depends on the number of 10B atoms delivered to the tumor, the subcellular distribution of 10B and the thermal neutron fluence at the site of the tumor. Monte Carlo calculations of the energy depositions of short-range particles with high LET coming from 10B disintegrations were performed and compared to the observed biological effects. The simulation allows us to study the influence of the localization of intracellular 10B in the nucleus, cytoplasma, plasma membrane or extracellular space. The biological response function which describes the probability of the lethal effect produced by a single particle track through the cell nucleus was found by comparing the calculated microscopic dose distribution spectra for single events with the survival observed experimentally. Calculations for a human melanoma cell population treated as a monolayer in the presence or absence of boron with d(14)+Be neutrons will be demonstrated. Two different boron compounds enriched in 10B were investigated in this study: boric acid (H3 10BO3) and p-dihydroxyboryl phenylalanine (BPA). The study shows that a high fraction of BPA enters the cytoplasm while boric acid was found only in the extracellular space. The computer simulations indicate that BPA yields a higher potential effectiveness for inactivation of melanoma cells than boric acid
