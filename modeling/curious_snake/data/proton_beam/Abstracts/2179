OBJECTIVE: To reduce the acute toxic and side-effect of radiotherapy with Huoxue Yiqi Yangyin recipe (HYYR). METHODS: Seventy-two nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients that using radiotherapy were divided into two groups: HYYR group (A) and the control group (B) using Wisk lotion for gargling or apply at the skin lesion. RESULTS: The injury on mucous membrane of mouth cavity and skin were 47.2%, 91.7%, 13.9%, 33.3% in group A and B respectively, the degree of injury was different (P < 0.01). The acute reaction of the mucous membrane of mouth cavity did not occur until the cumulative radiation were 41.4 +/- 9.4, 30.9 +/- 8.9 in group A and B respectively, there was significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: HYYR can reduce the acute radioactive reaction of the skin and mucous membrane of mouth cavity and inhibition of bone marrow
