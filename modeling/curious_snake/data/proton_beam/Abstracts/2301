The most efficacious treatment method for head and neck cancer is not yet defined. However, there have been some improvements made in the radiotherapy of head and neck cancer that are encouraging. Both hyperfractionated radiation therapy and accelerated radiation therapy have improved the local control rates in numerous primary sites, and the results of more rigorous prospective randomized studies, if positive, will justify more routine use of these techniques. The use of neutrons for unresectable salivary gland tumors has clearly been established as the treatment of choice. Local control as well as cosmetic outcome is excellent, with the only disadvantage being that neutron therapy is not as widely used as photon radiation. The same is true for charged particle therapy, the greatest utility of which appears to be for relatively small tumors adjacent to critical structures such as the brain and spinal cord. We also believe that intraoperative radiation therapy shows great promise and may soon be more widely available for the treatment of head and neck cancers. However, we believe that the most exciting advancement in the treatment of head and neck cancer is the use of concomitant radiation therapy and chemotherapy, a topic that is discussed in detail in another article in this issue.
