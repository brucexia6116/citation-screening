This review summarises current developments in radiation oncology and how they impact on the management of children with brain tumours. Improved understanding of radiobiology has led to attempts to improve the therapeutic ratio with hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Recent advances in planning and delivery of radiotherapy, including three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, and proton therapy allow a more precise localisation of the maximum dose region with maximum sparing of normal brain. Increasingly interactions between drugs and radiotherapy are exploited, but it is important to evaluate toxicity of combined modality therapy. The introduction of models to predict the impact of radiotherapy dose-volume parameters on long-term neuropsychological function will hopefully lead to further benefit with respect to sparing of normal tissue morbidity.
