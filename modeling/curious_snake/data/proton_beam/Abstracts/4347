The influence of field-defining shielding blocks on the output of a cobalt unit and of seven different accelerators (one with dual energy output) has been investigated. The quality indices range from 0.57 (cobalt-60) to 0.79. The loss in output due to shielding blocks has been calculated taking into account loss in phantom scatter only. Comparison with experimental results shows that the calculation algorithm is correct in most of the clinical conditions. However, for quality indices of 0.70 and higher, for blocks close to the central beam axis, an overestimation of the output by the algorithm has been found. The maximum deviation observed is about 5% for the highest energy and for block positions corresponding to those applied, e.g. for inverted Y-fields with narrow lumbo-aortic block spacing
