INTRODUCTION: It is an accepted fact that the local recurrence rate can be decreased up to 50% for the metastatic rectum tumours irradiated only preoperatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 181 patients having rectum tumour were irradiated preoperatively with 36 or 40 Gy between 1990 and 2001. The classification was made according to the modified Astler-Coller pathological staging system. The radiation treatment was carried out with telecobalt unit or high energy photon of linear accelerator after computerized radiation treatment planning. RESULTS: The most important characterizing factor for the efficiency of the preoperative irradiation is the local recurrence rate that was found to be 21.56% in our investigation. The survival rate was significantly influenced by the age of the patient and the applied dose. CONCLUSION: Our statistical analysis was applied to investigate the efficiency of the only preoperatively irradiated patients. The results are in agreement with the reported contributions
