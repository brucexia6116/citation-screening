Pelvic radiation doses exceeding 4,000-4,500 cGy are known to be associated with acute and chronic radiation enteropathy. This same radiation dose is, at the same time, only moderately effective in the elimination of microscopic malignancy, let alone gross clinical disease. Numerous medical and surgical attempts to minimize this complication have been uniformly unsuccessful. With the availability of a new synthetic, absorbable, polyglycolic acid mesh, an intestinal sling surgical procedure has been devised to exclude the small bowel from the pelvis and subsequent radiation fields. Twenty-five patients have been treated by this new technique with only one complication presenting as a fungal infection. Small-bowel barium contrast studies in 16 patients referred for postoperative radiation demonstrated 13 satisfactory exclusions of the small bowel from the translateral pelvic irradiation field. In 16 evaluable patients, three had unsatisfactory exclusion two of which were due to technical error. This has permitted high-dose (5,500-6,500 cGy) radiotherapy to the critical treatment volume without posttreatment complication. Mean follow-up time is 14.8 months. Several patients have been reexplored demonstrating complete absorption of the mesh without fibrinous adhesions or other foreign body reaction. It is concluded that this new technique of small bowel exclusion will permit the routine delivery of much higher doses of radiation in patients requiring improved local-regional control of their pelvic cancers and without morbidity from radiation-associated small bowel injury
