In 2000, the University of Strathclyde, collaborating with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, organized the first workshop dealing with the potential of high-power laser technology in medicine. Two areas of potential were identified: firstly the production of positron emission tomography (PET) isotopes; and secondly, the potential for laser-accelerated proton and heavy ion beams for therapy. The attendees, mainly clinicians and radiation physicists, emphasised that the laser community should concentrate on developing laser and target technology for therapy rather than isotope production because of the potential advantages over conventional accelerator technology for that purpose. On the 30 March 2007, the universities of Strathclyde and Paisley organized a follow-up meeting to identify the progress made in laser-driven proton and ion beam technology with applications leading to proton and ion beam therapy for deep-seated tumours. The meeting was supported by the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance (SUPA)--an organization set up in Scotland to bring together all of the physics departments collaborating with life scientists to work on ground-breaking new science which no single university could attempt. This is a summary of the meeting
