We describe a method for fast calculation of biological effects after ion irradiation. It is an alternative derivative of the established local effect model (LEM) and has been integrated into GSI's TRiP98 treatment planning system. We show that deviations from our classic approach for treatment planning are less than 5% for therapeutical doses, but calculational speed can be improved by one to two orders of magnitude. This will allow sophisticated methods of treatment planning for ion irradiation, taking biological effects fully into account
