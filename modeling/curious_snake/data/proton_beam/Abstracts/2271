The most frequently used medical treatment of Graves' ophthalmopathy is the combination of orbital irradiation and systemic corticosteroid. In this study the effectiveness of "high dose intravenous immunoglobulin" (IVIG) in Graves' ophthalmopathy treatment is explored. 11 patients were treated with orbital radiotherapy combined with systemic corticosteroid (Group 1), while 10 patients were treated with the combination of orbital irradiation and IVIG (Group 2). The therapeutic effect was assessed by an ophthalmopathy index based on the American Thyroid Association, classification of ocular changes of Graves' ophthalmopathy. All signs and symptoms of endocrine ophthalmopathy improved significantly in both groups. The mean ophthalmopathy index decreased from 7.0 +/- 1.3 to 3.4 +/- 1.5 in Group 1, and from 7.0 +/- 1.8 to 3.0 +/- 2.1 in Group 2. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between Group 1 and 2 mean initial and final ophthalmopathy index, and a significant difference between initial and final ophthalmopathy index both in Group 1 and 2. While side effects were present in Group 1 treated with systemic corticosteroid, no side effect was observed in patients treated with IVIG. These preliminary results suggest that IVIG is safe and effective in the treatment of Graves' ophthalmopathy
