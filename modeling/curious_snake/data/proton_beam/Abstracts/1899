We report a case of atypical circumscribed choroidal hemangioma with retinal detachment in a 41-year-old man referred with the diagnosis of Harada disease. B. Scan ultrasonography showed an hyperechogenic area extended through the sclera. Careful examination of the fundus showed a small peripapillary orange mass and an inferior retinal detachment. Surgical exploration revealed an extrascleral hemangioma. Proton beam irradiation was followed by retinal reattachment within three months. No recurrence has been observed 18 months after treatment
