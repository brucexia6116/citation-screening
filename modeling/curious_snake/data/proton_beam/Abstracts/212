A quality assurance method was developed to investigate the effects of residual target motion for hypofractionated spine radiosurgery. The residual target motion (target movement between successive image-guided corrections) was measured on-line via dual x-ray imagers for patients treated with CyberKnife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), a robotic linear accelerator with intrafractional image-tracking capability. The six degree-of-freedom characteristics of the residual target motion were analyzed, the effects of such motion on patient treatment delivery were investigated by incorporating the probability distribution of the residual motion into the treatment planning dose calculations, and deviations of the doses from those originally planned were calculated. Measurements using a programmable motion phantom were also carried out and compared with the static treatment plan calculations. It was found that the residual target motions were patient specific and typically on the order of 2 mm. The measured dose distributions incorporating the residual target motion also exhibited 2.0 mm discrepancy at the prescription isodose level when compared with the static treatment plan calculations. For certain patients, residual errors introduced significant uncertainties (-1 Gy) for the dose delivered to the spinal cord, especially at the high dose levels covering a small volume of the spinal cord (e.g., 0.1 cc). In such cases, stringent cord constraints and frequent monitoring of the target position should be implemented
