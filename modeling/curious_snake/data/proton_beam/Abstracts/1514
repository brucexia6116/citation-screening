A new method for evaluation of bremsstrahlung spectra from transmission measurements has been developed. In this method some very well known facts relating to thick target bremsstrahlung spectra are a priori included in the calculation procedure. Some characteristics of the method are preliminarily illustrated on a 6 MV therapy linear accelerator
