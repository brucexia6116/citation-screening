A doorless entry system has been designed for use in high-energy radiation therapy rooms. The doorless entry improves patient access, safety and throughput, increases the physical safety for the radiation therapists, and avoids the significant cost of heavy shielding doors. The design meets concerns relating to radiation safety, operational ease, and authorized entry. The new system is currently operating in one room housing a cobalt-60 unit and is to be employed in five additional rooms housing dual-energy accelerators (maximum energies of 10 and 18 MV). The doorless entry has received wide approval from the radiation therapists and no concerns have been expressed with respect to unauthorized entry or radiation safety
