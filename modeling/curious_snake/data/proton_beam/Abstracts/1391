Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H1-MRS) has been increasingly receiving more attention from radiologists, neurosurgeons, radiation and medical oncologists in the "in situ" clinical evaluation of human tumors. The utilization of H1-MRS, especially in human brain tumors, coupled to both routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI techniques provides greater information concerning tumor grading and extension and characterization of the normal surrounding tissue than what is possible with any other imaging technique alone. In this paper, we will review the current status of proton MR spectroscopy with emphasis on its clinical utility to diagnose tumors, its utility in planning surgical and radiation therapy interventions, and in its use in monitoring tumor treatment.
