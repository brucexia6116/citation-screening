The treatment delivery time of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with a multileaf collimator (MLC) is generally longer than that of conventional radiotherapy. In theory, removing the flattening filter from the treatment head may reduce the beam-on time by enhancing the output dose rate, and then reduce the treatment delivery time. And in practice, there is a possibility of delivering the required fluence distribution by modulating the unflattened non-uniform fluence distribution. However, the reduction of beam-on time may be discounted by the increase of leaf-travel time and (or) verification-and-recording (V&R) time. Here we investigate the overall effect of flattening filter on the treatment delivery time of IMRT with MLCs implemented in the step and shoot method, as well as with compensators on six hybrid machines. We compared the treatment delivery time with/without flattening filter for ten nasopharynx cases and ten prostate cases by observing the variations of the ratio of the beam-on time, segment number, leaf-travel time and the treatment delivery time with dose rate, leaf speed and V&R time. The results show that, without the flattening filter, the beam-on time reduces for both static MLC and compensator-based techniques: the number of segments and the leaf-travel time increase slightly for the static MLC technique; the relative IMRT treatment delivery time decreases more with lower dose rate, higher leaf speed and shorter V&R overhead time. The absolute treatment delivery time reduction depends on the fraction dose. It is not clinically significant at a fraction dose of 2 Gy for the technique of removing the flattening filter, but becomes significant when the fraction dose is as high as that for radiosurgery
