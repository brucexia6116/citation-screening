Experimental data for mixed radiation of different LET are analysed using an isobologram approach and are shown to be consistent with the special case of 'zero interaction' in a general formulation of the effect of a combination of agents proposed by Berenbaum. This zero interaction is defined in the same sense as interaction between the lesions produced by the same radiation. This makes analysis and predictions of mixed radiation results particularly straightforward. The zero-interaction formula can be mathematically derived from a simple model of mixed radiation called the lesion additivity model using the assumption that different early lesions produced in the radiation mixture can gradually develop into an indistinguishable intermediate state and hence become additive to produce the same end point. The model is shown to be applicable to irradiation under both hypoxic and oxygenated conditions and hence is extended to the use of hypoxic cell sensitisers
