The number of prostate cancer patients is rapidly increasing in Japan, as aging people are more common and the lifestyle is more westernized. Another reason is that prostate specific antigen (PSA) is prevalent and PSA test can detect organ-confined prostate cancer in the early stage. In the past, endocrine therapy was the main treatment modality since many prostate cancer patients were diagnosed in the advanced stage. However, endocrine therapy is not suitable for young patients with organ-confined prostate cancer. Surgery and radiation therapy are becoming standard therapy for these patients. Although retropubic radical prostatectomy is widely performed,urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction are still problems. Other approaches such as laparoscopic prostatectomy, portless endoscopic prostatectomy and perineal prostatectomy are also performed. Radiation therapy is commonly used for organ-confined prostate cancer in Europe and the U.S.A. The advancement in computer technology has made it possible to accumulate enough radiation dose to target without damaging the surrounding organs (3 D conformal, intensity-modulated radiotherapy). Heavy ion particle radiotherapy is also attempted in some institutes. Moreover, brachytherapy can be another choice in radiation therapy. In Japan, only high-dose brachytherapy with (192)Ir has been performed. In July 2003, permanent seed brachytherapy with (121)I was legally approved in Japan, and more organ-confined prostate cancer patients are expected to undergo this treatment. There are several treatment modalities for organ-confined prostate cancer patients these days. Therefore, not only tumor grade and stage, but also patients'lifestyle and thought should be considered in determining treatment. [References: 17]
