Squamous cell cancer of the trachea is an uncommon malignancy infrequently cured by either surgery or irradiation. Failure to control the primary tumor has been the most common cause for death. Our experience in three patients with small squamous cell cancer of the trachea treated by definitive irradiation is encouraging. The primary tumor was controlled in each patient. Histologic confirmation of tumor sterilization was observed in two. One patient remains alive and well at 54 months; one patient developed an epidural metastases at 16 months and subsequently died; and the third patient developed a separate primary lung cancer at 48 months. Two patients developed significant radiation complications
