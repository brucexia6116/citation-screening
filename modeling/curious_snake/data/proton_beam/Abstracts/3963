Chromosomal lesions, mitotic index and cell cycle progression delay induced by neutron (protons 34 MeV on beryllium) and neon (250 MeV/i) particles are studied in human lymphocytes. The cell cycle progression is slightly decreased at a dose of 1 Gy. Mitotic indexes are significantly decreased after irradiation by the different particles, except neon in 52-h cultures. By comparison to chromosome damages caused by gamma-rays, previously published, it is found that the lesions observed here are frequently more complex: the number of breaks is higher per abnormal mitosis and higher per rearrangement on the average. This complexity is higher for neon ions than for neutron beams
