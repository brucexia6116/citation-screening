Integrating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) functionality with a radiotherapy accelerator can facilitate on-line, soft-tissue based, position verification. A technical feasibility study, in collaboration with Elekta Oncology Systems and Philips Medical Systems, led to the preliminary design specifications of a MRI accelerator. Basically the design is a 6 MV accelerator rotating around a 1.5 T MRI system. Several technical issues and the clinical rational are currently under investigation. The aim of this paper is to determine the impact of the transverse 1.5 T magnetic field on the dose deposition. Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate the dose deposition kernel in the presence of 1.5 T. This kernel in turn was used to determine the dose deposition for larger fields. Also simulations and measurements were done in the presence of 1.1 T. The pencil beam dose deposition is asymmetric. For larger fields the asymmetry persists but decreases. For the latter the distance to dose maximum is reduced by approximately 5 mm, the penumbra is increased by approximately 1 mm, and the 50% isodose line is shifted approximately 1 mm. The dose deposition in the presence of 1.5 T is affected, but the effect can be taken into account in a conventional treatment planning procedure. The impact of the altered dose deposition for clinical IMRT treatments is the topic of further research
