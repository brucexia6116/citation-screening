Eighty-two patients with choroidal melanomas were treated with helium ion charged particle irradiation. Seventy-eight of 82 patients have either remained stable or demonstrated tumor shrinkage. Forty-five of 46 patients followed for at least 1 year after therapy have demonstrated tumor regression with a mean tumor shrinkage of approximately 31%. No tumor-related mortality has been observed. The most effective method of choroidal melanoma management is unclear. Charged particle external beam irradiation may be more applicable and have less ocular morbidity than either radioactive plaques or photocoagulation
