With modern urbanization trends, situations occur where a general-purpose multi-storey building would have to be constructed adjacent to a radiotherapy facility. In cases where the building would not be in the primary x-ray beam, "skyshine" radiation is normally accounted for. The radiation scattered from the roof side-wise towards the building can also be a major contributing factor. However, neither the NCRP reports nor recently published literature considered this. The current paper presents a simple formula to calculate the dose contribution from scattered radiation in such circumstances. This equation includes workload, roof thickness, field size, distance to the reference point and a normalized angular photon distribution function f(theta), where theta is the angle between central axis of the primary beam and photon direction. The latter was calculated by the Monte Carlo method (EGS4 code) for each treatment machine in our department. For angles theta exceeding approximately 20 degrees (i.e., outside the primary beam and its penumbra) the angular distribution function f(theta) was found to have little dependence on the shielding barrier thickness and the beam energy. An analytical approximation of this function has been obtained. Measurements have been performed to verify this calculation technique. An agreement within 40% was found between calculated and measured dose rates. The latter combined the scattered radiation and the dose from "skyshine" radiation. Some overestimation of the dose resulted from uncertainties in the radiotherapy building drawings and in evaluation of the "skyshine" contribution
