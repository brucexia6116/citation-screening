The purpose of this manuscript is to describe a method for designing a broad beam of electrons suitable for total skin electron irradiation (TSEI). A theoretical model of a TSEI beam from a linear accelerator with a dual scattering system has been developed. The model uses Fermi-Eyges theory to predict the planar fluence of the electron beam after it has passed through various materials between the source and the treatment plane, which includes scattering foils, monitor chamber, air, and a plastic diffusing plate. Unique to this model is its accounting for removal of the tails of the electron beam profile as it passes through the primary x-ray jaws. A method for calculating the planar fluence profile for an obliquely incident beam is also described. Off-axis beam profiles and percentage depth doses are measured with ion chambers, film, and thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD). The measured data show that the theoretical model can accurately predict beam energy and planar fluence of the electron beam at normal and oblique incidence. The agreement at oblique angles is not quite as good but is sufficiently accurate to be of predictive value when deciding on the optimal angles for the clinical TSEI beams. The advantage of our calculational approach for designing a TSEI beam is that many different beam configurations can be tested without having to perform time-consuming measurements. Suboptimal configurations can be quickly dismissed, and the predicted optimal solution should be very close to satisfying the clinical specifications
