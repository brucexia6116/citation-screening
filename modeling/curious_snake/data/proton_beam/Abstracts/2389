Two approaches to estimate the optimal radiographic magnification for a TV camera-based portal imaging system and portal films have been used. The first approach optimizes signal transfer while the second optimizes signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) transfer. In order to perform these optimization calculations, the physical characteristics of the imaging system (modulation transfer function and noise power spectrum) as well as the sizes of the radiation sources of our medical linear accelerators have been measured. Using these data, the optimal magnification considering signal transfer alone (M signal) has been calculated to range between 2.0 and 2.3 for the TV camera-based imaging system and is about 1.0 for portal films. Conversely, the optimal magnification considering SNR transfer (MSNR) has been calculated to range between 1.5 and 1.7 for the TV camera-based imaging system and is about 1.0 for portal films. The results suggest that most portal imaging systems are operated close to their optimal radiographic magnification
