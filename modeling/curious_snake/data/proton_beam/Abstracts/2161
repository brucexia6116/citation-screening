Several methods have been developed for the dosimetry of asymmetric radiation fields formed by independently moving collimator jaws. Three of these methods, based on different principles and modified to comply with our set of available data, are utilized for the calculation of asymmetric field dose profiles. All three methods use output factors and per cent depth doses or tissue maximum ratios of symmetric fields. In the first method, calculation of the off-centre ratio (OCR) of the asymmetric field is based on the symmetric field from which the asymmetric is originated, by setting the one jaw in an asymmetrical position. In the second method the OCR of the symmetric field is used for the OCR calculation of the asymmetric field of the same size; whereas the third method does not allow for the asymmetric OCR calculation. The results obtained using data for the 6 MV photon beam of a Philips SL-20 linear accelerator indicate that both the first and second method can accurately reproduce asymmetric field profiles from symmetric field data; the third method does not allow for penumbra reproduction, but it is accurate at the central part of the asymmetric field. The problems encountered in the application of the three methods are reported and their accuracy is compared
