Data on the uptake and retention of Ra and Pu in ocular tissues are reviewed. These data were used to calculate alpha radiation doses to the lens of the eye for patients injected with 224Ra and for individuals exposed to one annual limit on intake (ALI) per year of 224Ra, 226Ra, 228Ra and 239Pu for a period of 50 y. On the basis of this analysis, it is concluded that the induction of lens opacity should not be the factor limiting intake of any radioisotope of Pu or for 224Ra or 226Ra. However, for 228Ra the dose lies within the range of doses received by 224Ra patients who have developed cataracts
