An important factor in the design of primary protective barriers is the use factor. The present study was aimed at obtaining historical data on the use factor of two dual modality linear accelerators in a radiotherapy department. Gantry angle, field size, and beam modifiers were recorded for all radiation qualities in use at two medical linear accelerators with 6 MV and 18 MV x-rays and multiple electron energies ranging from 4 MeV to 20 MeV. The data for one year of clinical use was extracted from a record and verifying system and an estimate of the physics workload on the machines was obtained by going through the quality assurance records and machine log books. Of the total dose of approximately 37,000 Gy delivered in one year at isocenter on each unit 80% was given as 6 MV x-rays. As can be expected, most x-ray beams were directed at the four cardinal gantry angles with the angular distribution for 6 MV and 18 MV x-rays being very similar. Electron fields were broadly distributed around the gantry pointing down position. Less than 25% of all clinical x-ray treatment fields extended beyond a field size of 200 cm2
