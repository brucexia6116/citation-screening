OBJECTIVE: To describe intraoperative radiotherapy with accelerated electrons, a highly selective method of administering irradiation for radical treatment of bladder cancer. METHODS: We reviewed the experience reported in the literature since this treatment modality was utilized in Japan and its application extended to the western countries. RESULTS: Animal experiments have shown an acceptable clinicopathological tolerance to 20 Gy intraoperative irradiation of partial bladder volume. The local recurrence rate was 9% for early solitary tumor (> T2) and 27% for early multicentric tumor, according to the Japanese clinical experience. In the western countries, intraoperative radiotherapy plus external irradiation with or without systemic chemotherapy achieves a pT0 of about 65% (in total cystectomy specimens) and an intravesical tumor control rate of 88% in organ-sparing protocols. CONCLUSIONS: The results achieved by the groups with wider experience demonstrate that highly selective intraoperative radiotherapy is feasible, well-tolerated and effective in terms of inducing complete pathological remissions and definitive control of intravesical tumor. These selected clinical experiences must be corroborated by multicenter studies. [References: 19]
