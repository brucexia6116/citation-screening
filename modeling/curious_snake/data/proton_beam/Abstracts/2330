Relative biological effectiveness (RBE), as a function of linear energy transfer (LET), is evaluated for different types of damage contributing to mammalian cell reproductive death. Survival curves are analysed assuming a linear-quadratic dose dependence of lethal lesions. The linear term represents lethal damage due to single particle tracks, the quadratic term represents lethality due to interaction of lesions from independent tracks. RBE-LET relationships of single-track lethal damage, sublethal damage, potentially lethal damage and DNA double-strand breaks (dsb) are compared. Single-track lethal damage is shown to be composed of two components: damage that remains unrepaired in an interval between irradiation and assay, characterized by a very strong dependence on LET, with RBEs up to 20, and potentially lethal damage, which is weakly dependent on LET with RBEs < 3. Potentially lethal damage and sublethal damage depend similarly on LET as DNA dsb. The identification of these different components of damage leads to an interpretation of differences in radiosensitivity and in RBEs among various types of cells. [References: 23]
