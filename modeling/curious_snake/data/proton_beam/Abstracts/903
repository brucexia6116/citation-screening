The NanoMate robot has been coupled to a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer at 9.4 T and implemented for the first time for complex carbohydrate analysis. It was optimized in the negative ion mode to achieve automated sample delivery on the chip along with increased sensitivity, ultra-high resolution and accurate mass determination. A novel bracket has been designed to allow a reliable mounting of the NanoMate to the Apollo electrospray ionization (ESI) source of an APEX II instrument. The notably higher efficiency of ionization for compositional mapping of complex mixtures and feasibility for fragmentation analysis of components by sustained off-resonance irradiation collision-induced tandem mass spectrometry (SORI-CID MS2) has been demonstrated on a glycoconjugate mixture containing O-glycosylated sialylated peptides from urine of a patient suffering from a hereditary N-acetylhexosaminidase deficiency (Schindler's disease), previously analyzed by capillary-based nanoESI-FTICRMS, and of a healthy control person. Due to its potential to generate highly charged ionic species, reduce the in-source fragmentation, increase sensitivity, reproducibility and ionization efficiency, along with the ability to generate a sustained and constant electrospray, this method can be considered as a new platform for advanced glycomics.
