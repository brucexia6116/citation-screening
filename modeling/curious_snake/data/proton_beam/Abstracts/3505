The characteristics of swept electron beams produced by Sagittaire or Saturne type accelerators were investigated by film dosimetry. Beam sections perpendicular to the beam limiting system (BLS) axis are fully described by Gaussian curves close to the centre of the field defined by the BLS, but they become more and more distorted as the elementary beam approaches the BLS. The swept area was also evaluated and was related to the magnitude of the current applied to the two orthogonal magnets of the sweeping system
