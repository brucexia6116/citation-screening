A PTW Riga diamond detector and LiF TLDs have been evaluated for use in proton beam dosimetry by comparing results of proton beam calibration with those obtained using thimble ionization chambers. The thimble ionization chambers were calibrated in terms of exposure while the TLDs and diamond detector were calibrated in terms of absorbed dose in a 60Co beam. Absorbed doses to muscle in proton beams for ionization chambers were derived using the TG 20 charged particle protocol. Absorbed doses to muscle for solid state detectors were derived using absorbed dose proton beam quality correction factors. Differences between the derived doses for ionization chambers and solid state detectors were found to be within the uncertainties of measurements: 4.5% for ionization chambers and 5% for solid state detectors
