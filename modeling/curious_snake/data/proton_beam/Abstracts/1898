This article begins with a brief introduction to the concepts and techniques of linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery. The expanding role of radiosurgery in the treatment of brain tumors is explored in depth, including detailed discussions of the five intracranial neoplasms most frequently treated with radiosurgery. These include both benign (i.e., vestibular schwannoma, meningioma, pituitary adenoma) and malignant (i.e., cerebral metastasis, malignant glioma) pathologies. For each of these, a thorough review of published radiosurgical results is presented along with a discussion of common treatment modalities. The role of radiosurgery in the treatment of brain tumors continues to be defined, but an effort is made to provide reasonable indications for and against radiosurgery based on the current state of the art.
