This work studied the surface percent depth dose of 6 and 15 MV X-rays, 10 x 10 cm2 and 20 x 20 cm2 fields by Monte Carlo simulation. The OMEGA/BEAM code, an EGS4 user code developed by the NRCC, was used. The linac, Siemens PRIMUS, was accurately modeled according to the ion chamber and CEA film measurement, and the phase space data generated from this linac were collected to simulate dose distribution in water. The water phantom had radius 30 cm and thickness 10 cm. The percent depth doses at zero depth, PDDsurface, for 6 MV X-rays were 13.85 +/- 0.11% and 23.21 +/- 0.20% for the 10 x 10 cm2 and 20 x 20 cm2 fields, respectively. For 15 MV X-rays, PDDsurface values were 8.83 +/- 0.07% and 18.60 +/- 0.12% for the 10 x 10 cm2 and 20 x 20 cm2 fields, respectively
