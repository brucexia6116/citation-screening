This paper addresses some of the pertinent questions relating to the assessment of radiation risk for humans in space; the paper is not intended as a comprehensive review. The radiation field is briefly summarised and doses to be expected are given based on recent on-board measurements. The problems in adapting terrestrial epidemiological data to the space situation are outlined. Apart from the intrinsic uncertainties in deriving risk factors the specific difficulties are mainly concerned with the effects of energetic charged particles for which no human data exist. The necessity for continuing ground-based research is stressed. Also discussed is whether the principles of radiation protection successfully applied on Earth are really suitable for the space situation or whether they should be replaced by a different approach.
