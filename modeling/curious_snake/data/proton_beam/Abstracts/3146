The beam characteristics of the 18-MV photon beam of a Varian Clinac 1800 are presented. The clinically relevant parameters of central axis depth dose, tissue-phantom ratios, peak-scatter factors, and relative output factors are discussed and compared to 18-MV beam data previously reported. The nominal beam energy was found to be 18.3 +/- 0.8 MV on the central axis. The beam symmetry and uniformity meet the manufacturer's specifications. The inverse-square law is applicable within 1.4% over the clinically useful range of distances and field sizes. An empirical fit equation for the central axis depth dose is presented
