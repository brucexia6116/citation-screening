Until 1983, more than 300 astrocytomas of degree III and IV have been irradiated all over the world with new types of radiation such as neutrons, protons, alpha particles, heavy ions, and pions. Up to now a therapeutic progress could not be achieved. Radiobiologic experimentations suggest that the dense ionisation is unfavorable in the irradiation of malignant cerebral tumors. The clinical radiotherapy research with protons should therefore be intensified and hyperfractionation should be critically reviewed. [References: 32]
