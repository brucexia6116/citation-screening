In 1972 GDR started with the treatment of tumor patients with fast neutrons on the base of oxygen-effect. That means a better sensitivity of radiation of anoxic cells against radiation with high LET in comparison to radiation of thin ionization. Every tumor contains some anoxic cells. Therefore a better effect is possible with doses that are tolerated by normal tissue. In the following the details of the problems are discussed
