OBJECTIVES: To review the current state of knowledge of radiation physics and radiobiology, combined modality treatments, the use of radiosensitizers and radioprotectors, new developments in radiation therapy, radiation safety principles, and the implications of radiation in advanced nursing practices. DATA SOURCES: Research and review articles, oncology nursing textbooks, and physics and medical oncology textbooks. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation therapy is an important entity in the treatment of cancer, used alone or in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy. Research continues to grow in the use of radiation therapy to control cancer, spare surrounding normal tissue, and reduce acute long-term toxicity. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: An understanding of radiobiology and physics will assist oncology nurses in providing proper education to the patient and managing radiation-induced side effects.
