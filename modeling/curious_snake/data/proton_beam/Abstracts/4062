The formation of a wide beam is found necessary for a clinical application of a fast electron beam. A method of formation using thin dispersion foils is the most common one. An electromagnetic method of formation has been worked out, and dose distributions of fast electrons formed by this method have been compared in the tissue equivalent medium with those formed with the help of dispersion foils. The effect of some of the individual units of the forming device in these two methods of formation has been assessed. The experiment was conducted on medical beta-trons B-15 and B-5M-25 manufactured in the USSR. The depth dose distributions of fast electrons along the beam central axis in the electromagnetic formation for electrons with an energy of 7-24 MEV, field 8 X 10 cm and DSS = 90 cm are presented. It has been established that the beam intensity in the electromagnetic formation is higher than in the utilization of dispersion foils. Depth dose distribution is better in the electromagnetic formation than in the utilization of dispersion foils
