A method of examination for coronary artery disease that is less invasive and easier than coronary angiography (CAG) has been sought. We have developed a dynamic intravenous coronary angiography (IVCAG) system using synchrotron radiation (SR) and have used it clinically. Four patients suspected of having angina pectoris underwent IVCAG. An SR beam was reflected asymmetrically with a silicon crystal to produce a wide (150 mm x 80 mm) and monochromatic (37 keV) X-ray beam, with an energy level to achieve high sensitivity to the contrast agent. Following an intravenous injection of contrast agent, irradiation was applied for 4 ms periods at 33 ms intervals for dynamic IVCAG at 30 images s-1. Images were acquired with an image intensifier and recorded with a digital fluorography system. The dynamic images permitted clear visualization of the coronary arteries and permitted evaluation of coronary anatomy. Two patients exhibited no stenotic lesions, one patient had a 90% stenosis in the right coronary artery, and the remaining patient had a 25% stenosis at the site of previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The total irradiation doses used for IVCAG were less than those for conventional angiography. Dynamic IVCAG can be readily used for the evaluation of coronary arteries
