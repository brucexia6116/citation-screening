Giant cell tumors of the skull base are rare neoplasms. This report reviews two cases of patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumors that were irradiated by a combination of photons and protons. Two females 29 and 14 years old were initially managed with one and three extensive surgical resections respectively. Radiation therapy was recommended in respect to tumor aggressiveness. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was performed based on a three-dimensional planning, and delivered a total dose of 59.4 CGE to 65.2 CGE respectively, administered in 5 sessions per week of 1.8-2 Gy/CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent). With 8 and 83 months follow-up, respectively, the youngest patient relapsed marginally 4 months post irradiation, while the second remained with NED. No complication developed in any of them. In conclusion, we have reviewed a total of 116 cases (114 previously published cases+2 new cases) and discuss the role and modalities of radiation therapy in the management of giant cell skull base tumors.
