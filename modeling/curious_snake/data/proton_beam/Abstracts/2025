A model is presented for irradiation of a cellular monolayer by an electron microbeam. Results are presented for two possible window designs, cells plated on the vacuum-isolation window and cells plated on Mylar above the vacuum-isolation window. Even for the thicker dual-membrane window that facilitates tissue culture and allows the target cell to be centered relative to the electron beam, the majority of the calculated beam spreading was contained in a volume typical of the mammalian HeLa cell line. None of the 10(4) electrons simulated at 25 keV were scattered into the spatial region occupied by neighbors of the target cell. Dose leakage was largest at 50 keV where the mean energy deposited in all neighbors was 21% of that deposited in the target cell. This ratio was reduced to 5% at 90 keV, the highest beam energy simulated. Lineal energy spectra of energy deposition events scored in the nucleus of the target cell became progressively more like the gamma-ray spectrum as the electron beam energy increased. Hence, our simulations provide strong support for the feasibility of a low-LET, single-cell irradiator
