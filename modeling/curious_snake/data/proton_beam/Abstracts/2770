Preliminary results are reviewed on the outcome of patients treated within two randomized studies with either p(60) + Be-neutrons or photons. Since April 1987 67 patients have been treated of which twelve have been included in a randomized study on head and neck cancer and 40 on pelvic cancer. The clinical treatment planning is presented in detail and discussed. The results presented are considered to be very preliminary, so that no attempt has been made to analyse and discuss them in detail
