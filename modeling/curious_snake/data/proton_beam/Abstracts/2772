In the present paper experimental results from radiobiological investigations of the sedimentation behaviour of damaged and restored DNA-subunits attached to the nuclear membrane have been summarized. The studies were carried out preferably with Chinese Hamster cells V79-4 irradiated with different kinds of radiation (gamma-rays, neutrons and carbon ions) using the nucleoid sedimentation technique. Single-strand breaks relax the supercoiled DNA in the subunits resulting in a decreased sedimentation velocity. Rejoining leads to a correct restoration of the structure as can be studied by means of postincubation irradiation. Double-strand breaks release DNA fragments, again leading to an increased sedimentation velocity. If the average number of the induced double-strand breaks per subunit increases to a number higher than one, the measured results suggest that the structures should not be restored completely. The results are compatible with a new repair model developed in our laboratory on the assumption that, firstly, the single DNA subunits are the sensitive target rather than the whole DNA and, secondly, the repair of DNA damage takes place independently in each subunit
