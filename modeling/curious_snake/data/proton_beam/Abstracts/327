PURPOSE: To investigate further the relationship between high linear energy transfer (LET) induced cell cycle arrests and the yield of chromosome aberrations observable in normal human fibroblasts at the first post-irradiation mitosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Normal human fibroblasts (AG01,522C) were exposed in G0/G1 to either 11 MeV u(-1) C ions (LET = 153.5 keV microm(-1)) or 9.9 MeV u(-1) Ni ions (LET = 2,455 keV microm(-1)), subcultured in medium containing 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and at multiple time-points post-irradiation the yield of chromosomal damage, the mitotic index and the cumulative BrdU-labelling index were determined. Furthermore, a mathematical approach was used to analyse the entire cell population. RESULTS: Following high LET exposure normal fibroblasts suffer a transient delay into S-phase and into mitosis as well as a prolonged, probably permanent cell cycle arrest in the initial G0/G1-phase. Cells that reach the first mitosis at early times carried less aberrations than those collected at later times indicating a relationship between cell cycle delay and the number of aberrations. However, with respect to the whole cell population, only a few aberrant fibroblasts are able to progress to the first mitosis. For all endpoints studied the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of C ions is in the range of 2 - 4, while for Ni ions RBE < 1 is estimated. In contrast, when compared on a per particle basis Ni ions with the higher ionization density were found to be more effective. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed analysis of the data demonstrates that the number of fibroblasts at risk for neoplastic transformation is significantly reduced by a chronic cell cycle arrest in the initial G0/G1-phase and, for the first time, the LET-dependence of this effect has been shown
