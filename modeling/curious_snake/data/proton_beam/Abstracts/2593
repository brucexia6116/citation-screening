In the authors' technique, the stereotactically localized target is fixed to the isocenter of a 4 MV linear accelerator. The irradiation is carried out along 9-17 non-coplanar arcs distributed on a 160 degrees cylindrical sector. High doses (10-50 Gy) are delivered in one or two sessions. From 1982, 65 patients have been treated (shortest follow-up 6 months). The dose was chosen according to the pathology and to the volume of the lesion. Good clinical results have been obtained in low-grade gliomas, acoustic neuromas, arteriovenous malformations, and other selected types of intracranial lesions. Therapeutic effects in terms of clinical condition and size of the lesions have been plotted in relation to time elapsed and dose employed
