The evaluation of the response to radiation therapy in brain tumor patients is a major and an important issue. Although CT and MRI can measure changes in tumor size, it is difficult to use these imaging methods to evaluate the viability or the proliferation activity of a tumor. In this study, we investigated the metabolite changes in glioma patients using 1H-MRS from before to after radiation therapy, to see whether or not early metabolic changes occur during therapy. Seven patients with histologically proven glioma (1 astrocytoma, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 2 oligoastrocytoma, 1 oligodendroglioma, 2 glioblastoma) were examined by means of 1H-MRS using a point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with a repetition time of 2,000 ms and echo times of 68 ms, 136 ms and 272 ms. The 1H-MRS was evaluated by both the spectrum pattern and the quantification of the metabolites. As to radiation therapy, each patient received a total dose of 64.8 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) with a 10-MeV linear accelerator. The results revealed that the concentration of choline-containing compounds (Cho) was 4.55 +/- 1.08 mmol/kg wet weight before radiation therapy and was reduced to 2.69 +/- 0.56 mmol/kg wet weight (p < 0.01) after radiation therapy. Moreover, both the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak and creatine/phosphocreatine (t-Cr) peak were lower after radiation therapy than before. The peaks of both the lipids (Lip) and lactate (Lac) were higher after radiation therapy than before. In conclusion, Cho concentration is thought to be a useful marker for the evaluation of early post-radiation response. The effect of radiation therapy can be evaluated according to the value of Cho. Further long-term MRS study is needed to prove whether or not the decrease of the Cho value in the present study will change before recurrence at later stages
