Myelopathy is a feared consequence of radiation therapy. Risk factors are multifocal; therefore, total dose calculation is crucial. We evaluated the contribution of scatter radiation to obtain an accurate cumulative spinal cord dose. Twenty patients undergoing three field head and neck radiation by Cobalt or 6 MV Linac had a total cord dose calculated from direct and scatter radiation. The cord was removed from the radiation field at tumor doses no higher than 4,400 cGy. Total tumor dose ranged from 5,400-7,400 cGy (mean 6060). All patients achieved the prescribed dose and none were lost to follow up (mean 36 months). It was found that scatter radiation can contribute as much as 20% extra dose to the spinal cord. Mean extra dose was 9% (range 1%-20%). This additional dose ranged from 52-810 cGy (mean 339 cGy). No apparent difference was seen with Cobalt or Linac source. Our conclusion was that significant additional dose is delivered to the spinal cord by scatter radiation and that scatter may contribute more to the development of myelopathy than previously believed
