In 37 patients with endosellar pituitary adenoma attended by the acromegaloid syndrome, a plasma STH level determined by a radioimmunoassay against a background of an insulin test was compared with EEG findings before and at varying time (up to 7 yrs.) after proton beam therapy using the synchrocyclotron of the Leningrad Institute of Nuclear Physics. EEG was shown to be an informative method of diagnosis of continuous pituitary adenoma growth and complications of proton beam therapy in the form of temporal paroxysms
