PURPOSE: To investigate the radiation dosimetry of a stable stent following activation by a linac photon beam. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A computer simulation is used in conjunction with neutron measurements to study the dosimetry of a stent activated by a linac photon beam. Two models are investigated. A gamma emitter, Model G108, with no half-life and 1.43 MeV average energy, and a beta emitter, Model D108, with 2.33 h half-life and 0.45 MeV average energy. RESULTS: Model D108 delivers a dose exceeding 1 Gy to the artery wall when exposed to an 18-MV photon beam. Model G108 requires a 25-MV photon beam to deliver a similar dose under the same conditions of irradiation. CONCLUSION: The very short to no half-life of InSituStent emissions makes the fractionation of the dose delivery possible. In addition, an InSituStent coated with an immunosuppressant drug may give patients the potential benefit of a combined radiation and drug treatments
