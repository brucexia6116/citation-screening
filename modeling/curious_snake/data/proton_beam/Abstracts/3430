A method of calculation of the three-dimensional dose-rate distribution for X-rays of Linac Neptun 10p and gamma-rays of Gamma-tron 80S is presented. The experimental results show that the profiles function defined as the relative dose-rate across the radiation beam is useful for this purpose, and it is sufficient to determine the profile function only at one depth and for one field size. The results of measurements are presented on the graphs
