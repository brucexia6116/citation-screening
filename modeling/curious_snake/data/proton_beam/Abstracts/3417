A method program were developed for computation of dosimetric characteristics of radiation fields in gamma-neutron irradiation of cancer patients. The program provided calculation of the distribution of isoeffective and absorbed doses and the time-dose-fractionation factor. Isodose charts could be obtained in the digital code or graphically
