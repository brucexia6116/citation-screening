PSI is still the only location in which proton therapy is applied using a dynamic beam scanning technique on a very compact gantry. Recently, this system is also being used for the application of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). This novel technical development and the success of the proton therapy project altogether have led PSI in Year 2000 to further expand the activities in this field by launching the project PROSCAN. The first step is the installation of a dedicated commercial superconducting cyclotron of a novel type. The second step is the development of a new gantry, Gantry 2. For Gantry 2 we have chosen an iso-centric compact gantry layout. The diameter of the gantry is limited to 7.5 m, less than in other gantry systems (approximately 10-12 m). The space in the treatment room is comfortably large, and the access on a fixed floor is possible any time around the patient table. Through the availability of a faster scanning system, it will be possible to treat the target volume repeatedly in the same session. For this purpose, the dynamic control of the beam intensity at the ion source and the dynamic variation of the beam energy will be used directly for the shaping of the dose
