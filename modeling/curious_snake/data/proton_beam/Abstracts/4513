Three patients with choroidal melanomas of the posterior pole were treated with proton beam irradiation. One tumor was medium-sized, two were large-sized. Two of the three eyes were functionally single eyes. 60 CGE (cobalt gray equivalents) was delivered in 4 equal treatments during 4 consecutive days. The minimum follow-up period for each patients is 4 years, the average time 4.8 years. Functionally, we lost both eyes with the large-sized tumors owing to severe radiogenic side effects; the eye containing the largest tumor had to be enucleated after 48 months because of phthisis bulbi. No metastases have developed up to now
