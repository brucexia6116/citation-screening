Surface dose measurements in therapeutic x-ray beams are of importance in determining the dose to the skin of patients undergoing radiotherapy. Measurements were performed in the 6-MV beam of a medical linear accelerator with LiF thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD) using a solid water phantom. TLD chips (surface area 3.17 x 3.17 cm2) of three different thicknesses (0.230, 0.099, and 0.038 g/cm2) were used to extrapolate dose readings to an infinitesimally thin layer of LiF. This surface dose was measured for field sizes ranging from 1 x 1 cm2 to 40 x 40 cm2. The surface dose relative to maximum dose was found to be 10.0% for a field size of 5 x 5 cm2, 16.3% for 10 x 10 cm2, and 26.9% for 20 x 20 cm2. Using a 6-mm Perspex block tray in the beam increased the surface dose in these fields to 10.7%, 17.7%, and 34.2% respectively. Due to the small size of the TLD chips, TLD extrapolation is applicable also for intracavity and exit dose determinations. The technique used for in vivo dosimetry could provide clinicians information about the build up of dose up to 1-mm depth in addition to an extrapolated surface dose measurement
