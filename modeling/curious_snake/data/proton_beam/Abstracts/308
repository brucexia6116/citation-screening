The impact of the oblique electron beam on the lateral buildup ratio (LBR), used in the electron pencil beam model to predict the per cent depth dose (PDD) and dose per monitor unit (MU) for an irregular electron field, was examined using Monte Carlo simulation. The EGSnrc-based Monte Carlo code was used to model electron beams produced by a Varian 21 EX linear accelerator for different beam energies, angles of obliquity and field sizes. The Monte Carlo phase space model was verified by measurements using electron diode and radiographic film. For PDDs of oblique electron beams, it is found that the depth of maximum dose (d(m)) shifts towards the surface as the beam obliquity increases. Moreover, for increasing the beam angle of obliquity, the depth doses just beyond d(m) decrease with depth. The depth doses then increase eventually in a deeper depth close to the practical range. The LBRs and pencil beam radial spread function, calculated using PDDs with different field sizes, are found varying with electron beam energies, angles of obliquity and cutout diameters. It is found that LBR increases along the normalized depth when the beam angle of obliquity increases. This results in a decrease of the radial spread function with an increase of beam obliquity. When the size of the electron field increases, the variation of LBR with beam angle of obliquity decreases. It should be noted that when calculating dose per MU for an oblique electron beam with an irregular field misunderstanding and neglecting the effect of beam obliquity would lead to a significant deviation. A database of LBRs for oblique electron beams can be created using Monte Carlo simulation conveniently and is recommended when an oblique beam is used in electron radiotherapy
