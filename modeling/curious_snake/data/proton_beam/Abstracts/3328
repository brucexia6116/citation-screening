For comparison of cytotoxicity from alpha-particle irradiation with that from conventional x-irradiation, 212Bi, an alpha-emitting radionuclide, was attached to a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a cell surface antigen on human pancreatic carcinoma cells. For a given level of survival, the 212Bi-antibody complex was found to be approximately 20 times more efficient in cell killing than x-irradiation and 5 times more cytotoxic when compared with the cytotoxicity of an antigen-negative cell line or an isotype-matched control antibody. High linear energy transfer radioimmunotherapy using alpha emitters linked to monoclonal antibodies may be useful in vivo and in vitro for selectively killing target cell populations, especially those resistant to other forms of treatment
