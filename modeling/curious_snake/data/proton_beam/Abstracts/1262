Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. Because endothelial cells are genetically stable, they rarely acquire resistance to anticancer modalities, and could, thus, be a suitable target for radiation therapy. Heavy ion radiation therapy has attracted attention as an effective modality for cancer therapy because of its highly lethal effects, but the effects of heavy ion irradiation on in vitro cell function associated with angiogenesis have not been reported. Our study found that in vitro angiogenesis was inhibited by high linear energy transfer carbon ion irradiation even at sublethal dose (0.1 Gy). ECV304 and HUVEC human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were irradiated with 290 MeV carbon ion beams of approximately 110 keV/ micro m or 4 MV X-ray of approximately 1 keV/ micro m. Their adhesiveness and migration to vitronectin or osteopontin were inhibited, and capillary-like tube structures in three-dimensional culture were destroyed after carbon ion irradiation concomitant with the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity, down-regulation of alphaVbeta3 integrin, which is one of the adhesion molecules, slight up-regulation of membrane type1- matrix metalloproteinase, and significant up-regulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2. On the other hand, sublethal X-ray irradiation promoted migration of endothelial cells, and the capillary-like tube structure in three-dimensional culture progressed even after 16 Gy irradiation. These results provide an implication that heavy ion beam therapy could be superior to conventional photon beam therapy in preventive effects on in vitro angiogenesis even at sublethal dose, and might inhibit angiogenesis in vivo
