An improvement of the Local Effect Model (LEM) is presented which takes clustered DNA damage into account. Single strand breaks (SSBs) and double strand breaks (DSBs) are distributed stochastically onto the DNA molecule and additional DSBs are recorded. Consideration of this additional damage leads to a modification of the underlying photon survival curve at high doses. As a consequence of the new approach, the ratio of maximum relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values to minimum RBEs is increased. This can be understood in terms of a higher radiation effect resulting from the cluster damage at high local doses. We find that the extended LEM including cluster effects reproduces experimental data for V79 cells significantly better than the original LEM
