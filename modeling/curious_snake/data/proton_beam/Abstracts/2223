With regard to vesica tumors, a remarkable difficulty for the interpretation of statistical data is often given by the different classifications that the different authors use. Therefore we have reported a comparative table always for being faithful to what we wished at the beginning of this work that has be useful to the doctor above all by a clinical point of view. In synthesis all the Authors think that radiotherapy is not the elective treatment for tumors in O or A stage, while it can be efficient in the therapy of vesica neoplasies in B1, B2 and C stages. The most Authors seem less favourable to preoperating irradiation of tumor above all for the unexact intraoperating valuation of "staging" that is inevitable after this treatment. Postoperating radiotherapy (5000-6000 R in 20-30 days) can be more useful in the cases of incomplete surgical exeresis although there is the problem of possible radiolesions of eventual uretero-intestinal anastomosis let alone of intestine. In the end urethra tumors are sensitive to radiotherapy for their superficiality and excellent tolerance of membrum to radiations that permits also the giving of 6000-7000 R in 4-6 days.
