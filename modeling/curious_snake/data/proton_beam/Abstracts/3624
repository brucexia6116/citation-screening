Considerable progress has been made during the last few years in evaluating patients with suspected choroidal melanomas but difficulties continue to persist. In this report, the authors describe three cases with an unusual localized posterior choroidal hemorrhage, which were thought to be choroidal melanomas and referred for proton beam irradiation. These limited hemorrhagic choroidal detachments presented as a dark brown mass of considerable elevation, but were discrete, well localized, and located posterior to the equator. Fluorescein angiography and ultrasonography may be of some value in differentiating these lesions from choroidal melanomas. Serial observations over time will establish the correct diagnosis
