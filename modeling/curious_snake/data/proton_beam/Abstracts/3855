A simple method for performing manual dose calculations in asymmetric fields is proposed. The method is based on a generalized central-axis dose calculation equation for which open- and wedged-field off-axis provisions have been made. A calculation form designed to document the calculation and simplify the calculation process is presented. Lastly, the required off-axis dosimetry data obtained from a dual-energy accelerator are shown
