The authors have analysed a case of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome with a persistent recurring course and a gradual development of resistance to steroid therapy. Computerized tomography revealed a high density zone in the affected cavernous sinus of the patient. Differential diagnosis between a tumor and Tolosa-Hunt syndrome was made. The patient received 3 fractions of proton beam irradiation by the "piercing" method (the beam being 15 mm in diameter) at a dose of 60 Gy. After irradiation computerized tomography showed complete recovery of disturbed functions and disappearance of the focus. Four-year remission was observed. In our experience, it was the first case of the use of radiation therapy in Tolosa-Hunt syndrome
