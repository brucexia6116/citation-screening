The changes in molecular characteristics of patients' blood after a totally therapeutic irradiation were studied by the NMR method. The changes in the intensity and shape of peaks attributed to methylene and methyl protons of fatty acids and lipoproteins were found in the NMR spectra of the blood plasma of the irradiated subjects. The data on the role of peroxide lipid oxidation in changes of lipid concentration in blood plasma were obtained. The changes in the composition of metabolites in the blood and their relative equilibrium level were found
