There is a potential to produce very high doses and dose rates on dual mode (electron and x-ray capability) medical electron accelerators [C. J. Karzmark, Br. J. Radiol. 40, 697 (1967)]. Measurements were taken on two accelerators to determine the size of the doses which were possible. The experiments demonstrate the limitations of many of the commonly used dosimeters when they are used outside of the dose and dose rate ranges normally encountered in a radiotherapy department. Dose rates from 110 to 165 cGy/pulse were measured using ionization chamber, ferrous sulphate and thermoluminescent dosimetry, and water calorimetry
