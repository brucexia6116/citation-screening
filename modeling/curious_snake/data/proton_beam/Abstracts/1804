Stereotactically-guided conformal radiotherapy is a practical technique for irradiating irregular lesions in the brain. The shaping of the conformal fields may be achieved using lead alloy blocks, a conventional multi-leaf collimator (MLC) or a mini/micro-MLC. Although the former gives more precise shaping, it is labour intensive. The latter methods are more practical as both mould room and treatment room times are reduced, but the shaping is limited by the finite leaf-width. This study compares treatment plans, in terms of normal tissue doses and tumour coverage, for fields shaped using conformal blocks and a conventional MLC in two series of geometrical shapes and nine patient tumours. For the range of tumour sizes considered (volumes 14-264 cm3, minimum dimension 30 mm, maximum 102 mm), the MLC treats, on average, 14% (range 3-34%) and 17% (range 0-36%) more normal brain tissue than conformal blocks to >50% and >80% of the prescription dose, respectively. The large variability is due to strong dependence on tumour shape and the presence of partial leaf-widths in the MLC fit. It is therefore important to consider both of these effects when deciding whether the MLC is appropriate for a particular target volume
