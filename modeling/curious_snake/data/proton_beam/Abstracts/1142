The influence of higher-order chromatin structure on the non-random distribution of DNA double-strand breaks induced by high-LET radiation was investigated. Five different chromatin structures (intact cells, condensed and decondensed chromatin, nucleoids and naked genomic DNA) from GM5758 cells or K562 cells were irradiated with (137)Cs gamma-ray photons and 125 keV/microm nitrogen ions (16-25 MeV/nucleon). DNA was purified with a modified lysis procedure to avoid release of heat-labile sites, and fragment size distributions and double-strand break yields were analyzed by different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocols. Whereas double-strand breaks in photon-irradiated cells were randomly distributed, irradiation of intact K562 cells with high-LET nitrogen ions produced an excess of non-randomly distributed DNA fragments 10 kb-1 Mbp in size. Complete removal of proteins eliminated this non-random component. There was a gradual increase in the yield of double-strand breaks for each chromatin decondensation step, and compared to intact cells, the yields for naked DNA (in buffer without scavengers) increased 83 and 25 times after photon and nitrogen-ion irradiation, respectively. The corresponding relative biological effectiveness decreased from 1.6-1.8 for intact cells to 0.49 for the naked DNA. We conclude that the organization of DNA into chromatin fiber and higher-order structures is responsible for the majority of non-randomly distributed double-strand breaks induced by high-LET radiation. However, our data suggest a complex interaction between track structure and chromatin organization over several levels
