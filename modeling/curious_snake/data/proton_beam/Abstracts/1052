Human peripheral lymphocytes were exposed to 137Cs gamma-rays (0-4.3 Gy) in order to check the impact of unstable cells on the dose-response curve for translocations. Chromosomes 2, 4 and 8 were FISH-painted. 17,720 first dividing cells were analysed. For the discrimination between stable and unstable cells the painted and the counter-stained chromosomes were analysed at doses of 1 Gy and higher. The cell distribution of translocations follows a Poisson distribution. The data were fitted to the linear-quadratic function, y = c + alphaD + betaD2. As expected, the alpha coefficients of the dose-response curves for translocations in stable cells or in total cells do not differ. However, at doses >1 Gy, the frequency of all translocations in stable cells seems to be lower than the frequency in total cells. For the establishment of calibration curves for past dose assessment purposes, only complete translocations should be scored, in order to estimate reliable doses. Copyright 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel
