Hypoxia and variations in cell cycle phase protect tumor cells being treated with x rays or gamma rays (cobalt). Heavy particles can overcome these protective effects, because of the dense ionization they deposit in tissues. Pions (negative pi mesons) can be directed to and stopped in a specific area, where they are captured by the nuclei of atoms, rendering the nuclei unstable. The nuclei disintegrate, releasing densely ionizing radiation. By confining the dense ionization to the tumor-bearing volume, pions have the potential of increasing the tolerance of the area under treatment to radiation, thus increasing the probability of destroying the tumor. A special channel at the proton factory at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory is producing pions for biomedical research. Considerable physical dosimetry has been completed. Cellular studies are underway to provide depth-dose-biological-effect curves. Animal studies will provide information on acute and late effects, which will permit the safe application of pions to a series of anatomical sites established by protocols for radiotherapy clinical trials
