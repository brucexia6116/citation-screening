OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and visual outcomes after proton therapy for subfoveal neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: Randomized dose-ranging clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-six patients with angiographic evidence of classic choroidal neovascularization resulting from AMD and best-corrected visual acuity of 20/320 or better. METHODS: Patients were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive 16-cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) or 24-CGE proton radiation in 2 equal fractions. Visual acuity was measured using standardized protocol refraction. Complete ophthalmological examinations, color fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography were performed before and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of eyes losing 3 or more lines of vision from baseline. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to compare cumulative rates of vision loss between the 2 treatment groups. RESULTS: At 12 months after treatment, 36 eyes (42%) and 27 eyes (35%) lost 3 or more lines of vision in the 16-CGE and 24-CGE groups, respectively. Rates increased to 62% in the 16-CGE group and 53% in the 24-CGE group by 24 months after treatment (P = 0.40). Radiation complications developed in 15.7% of patients receiving 16 CGE and 14.8% of patients receiving 24 CGE. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in rates of visual loss were found between the 2 dose groups. Proton radiation may be useful as an adjuvant therapy or as an alternative for patients who decline or are not appropriate for approved therapies
