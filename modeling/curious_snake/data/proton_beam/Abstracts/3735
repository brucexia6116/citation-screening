Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is a method which attempts to combine the radiobiological advantages offered by dose fractionation with a technique for focal delivery of radiation. At McGill University, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is given with a linear accelerator-based dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery unit. The first treatment is given using the stereotactic frame for target localization and head immobilization. Subsequent treatments are given using skin tattoos and laser alignment for target placement within the isocenter of the linear accelerator, and a modified portable halo-ring device is used for skull immobilization. Typically, a marginal dose of 42 Gy was prescribed at the margins of the lesion, divided in 6 fractions and given over a 2-week period. We report the pathological profile and treatment results in a series of 21 patients with a variety of intracranial tumors, treated in this manner between May 1987 and April 1990. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy appears to be a worthwhile procedure for the treatment of well-selected patients with intracranial neoplasms
