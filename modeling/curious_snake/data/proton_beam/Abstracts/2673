A safeguard system is described which minimizes the hazard of accidental exposure of radiotherapy and servicing staff. Upon entrance of the treatment room, each person other than the patient has to take a safety card from a box. After patient set-up, the radiation beam cannot be turned on unless all cards are properly returned to the box. Unlike the commonly used interlocks, which do not actually check the treatment area for unnoticed occupancy, the current system inhibits the radiation beam until every user has left. The issue of personal responsibility is clear-cut: people who use the safeguard system correctly are fully protected against accidental irradiation while anyone who disregards it is held responsible for possible self-exposure. This unambiguous message is contained in the concise instructions posted above the card box. A resetting procedure has been incorporated that successfully discourages any misuse of the system
