A semiempirical method for the calculation of the relative crossbeam dose profiles at depth is described. The parameters required to set up the formulae and their dependence with field size and depth are investigated. Using the above method, measured crossbeam dose profiles at depth from two linear accelerators, Philips (SL-18) and AEC (Therac-6) are reproduced. The results indicate that this method is applicable within a wide range of depths and field sizes
