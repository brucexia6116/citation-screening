Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may be a useful tool in both the initial diagnosis of cervical carcinoma and the subsequent surveillance after radiation therapy, particularly when other standard diagnostic methods are inconclusive. Single voxel magnetic resonance (MR) spectral data were acquired from 8 normal volunteers, 16 patients with cervical cancer before radiation therapy, and 18 patients with cervical cancer after radiation therapy using an external pelvic coil at a 1.5-T on a Signa system. The presence or absence of various resonances within each spectrum was evaluated for similarities within each patient group and for spectral differences between groups. Resonances corresponding to lipid and creatine dominated the spectrum for the eight normal volunteers without detection of a choline resonance. Spectra from 16 pretreatment patients with biopsy-proven cervical cancer revealed strong resonances at a chemical shift of 3.25 ppm corresponding to choline. Data acquired from the 18 posttreatment setting studies was variable, but often correlated well with the clinical findings. Biopsy confirmation was obtained in seven patients. H1 MRS of the cervix using a noninvasive pelvic coil consistently demonstrates reproducible spectral differences between normal and neoplastic cervical tissue in vivo. However, signal is still poor for minimal disease recurrence. Further study is needed at intervals before, during, and after definitive irradiation with biopsy confirmation to validate the accuracy of MRS in distinguishing persistence or recurrence of disease from necrosis and fibrosis
