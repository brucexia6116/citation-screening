The effects of alpha-particle irradiation on hamster and human lung cells have been studied. In both cases two end points were taken, cell death and the induction of chromosome aberrations. The hamster cells were common stock V79 cells; the human ones were freshly derived from fetal material. For both types of cells, the survival curves could be described by straight lines in the conventional exponential plot, with values of D(o) of 0.78 and 0.37 Gy for the hamster and human cells, respectively. The rate of induction of chromosome aberrations could also be described by straight lines with slopes of 0.30 and 0.62 aberration per cell per gray. Thus, for this second end point also, it appears that human cells are twice as sensitive to the effects of alpha-particle irradiation as hamster cells
