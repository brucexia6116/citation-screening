PURPOSE: To determine the role of proton therapy in patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1983 and 1991, 25 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (stages IIB-IVA) were treated with a curative intent by external photon irradiation to the pelvis, followed by proton irradiation to the primary tumor, delivering a median total tumor dose of 86 Gy (range 71 Gy/26 Fr-101 Gy/46 Fr), and were followed for a median period of 139 months (range 11-184 months). RESULTS: Ten-year overall survival rates for stages IIB and IIIB/IVA patients were 89% and 40%, respectively. Five-year local control rates for stages IIB and IIIB/IVA patients were 100% and 61%, respectively. Four percent of patients experienced severe (Grade 4 or more) late complications in the intestine or urinary bladder at 5 years. CONCLUSION: External photon and proton therapy is effective for those who are not eligible for intracavitary irradiation, and who otherwise have a poor prognosis. The results show that tumor control, survival, and morbidity are similar to those after conventional therapy
