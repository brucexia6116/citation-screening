The Library Least-Squares method has been applied to detect changes in the depth dose and in the profiles of 6 and 20 MeV electron beams, and in 6 MeV photon beams from medical linear accelerators. The changes in the beam energy of 0.78% and 0.32% at low and high electron energies, respectively, induced by the insertion of 0.1 mm A1 absorber were clearly visible in the residual distributions. The changes in the photon beam were introduced by rotation of the gantry or the collimator. The applicability of the method to quantitatively monitor any changes in the treatment beam characteristics is presented
