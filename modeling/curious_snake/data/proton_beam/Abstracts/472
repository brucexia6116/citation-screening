This paper describes the results of experimental studies performed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in a (12)C ion beam with the primary nominal energy 500 MeV amu(-1). Data measured by means of a diamond detector and a spectrometer of linear energy transfer (LET) based on chemically etched track detectors are presented, analysed and discussed. LET spectra are also calculated by program SRIM
