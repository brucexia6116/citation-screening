BACKGROUND. Prolactin-secreting pituitary carcinomas are uncommon, locally destructive neoplasms that rarely metastasize outside the central nervous system. The authors report a case of a prolactin-secreting tumor that initially presented as the empty sella syndrome. Two recurrences along transsphenoidal surgery tracts in cheek pouches were followed by distant metastases later in the abdomen and pelvis. Only 10 previous cases of either extracranial or intracranial metastases from prolactin-secreting pituitary carcinomas have been reported. No metastases below the diaphragm have been reported previously. METHODS. The patient's cheek pouch implants, lymph node metastases, ovarian metastases, and uterine metastases were studied with prolactin-specific immunohistochemistry. RESULTS. Long term treatment with bromocriptine, several debulking surgeries, extensive local radiation therapy (external beam and proton beam), and cytotoxic chemotherapy had little impact. Tamoxifen, however, may have slowed tumor growth. CONCLUSION. Tamoxifen may have efficacy in the treatment of prolactin-secreting pituitary carcinomas. [References: 43]
