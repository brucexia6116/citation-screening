The energy deposition patterns produced by the radiation environment in space can be quite different from those in conventional radiation environments. Furthermore, conventional radiation biological experiments, using randomly distributed particle tracks, cannot access some variables which may be important in determining the health effects of irradiation. Controlled microbeam irradiation provides the means to investigate the effects and unique energy deposition patterns and cell environment for a variety of end points
