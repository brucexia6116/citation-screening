It has been recognized that, for precise localization and verification of radiation fields, a marking drawn on the skin surface is not entirely reliable because its position relative to bony structures or internal organs is not stationary. This is especially true when treating deep-seated tumors located below the clavicle. In proton beam radiotherapy at the University of Tsukuba, we ristrict the margins around the target volume. Therefore, special care in field localization and verification is needed, and we make it a rule to take X-ray pictures on each treatment day. To accomplish this, we have developed a localize-and-verify system by using fluoroscopic techniques and combining it with a real-time digital image processing device. This allows for the formation of a digital image of the proton field and storage it in the optic disc. By using this system as well as verification films, filed placement errors were measured in 10 patients with deep-seated tumors. Out of a total of 190 localizations, 22% exhibited a field placement error of more than 5 mm, where patient positioning and field localization were done by using skin drawings aligned with laser beams. This result strongly suggests the necessity for daily localization and verification of radiation fields, as is being done by us, for precision in the execution of proton beam radiation therapy
