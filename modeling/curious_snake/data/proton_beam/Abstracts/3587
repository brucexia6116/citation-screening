Beams of protons have been used for radiation treatment for approximately 40 years. This paper provides a short summary of activities from institutions that have contributed to the field over this period. The paper reviews some of the basic interactions of protons with matter that are relevant to radiation treatment and summarizes current knowledge pertaining to the response of biological systems to proton beam radiation. The technical means of producing and delivering proton treatment beams are discussed along with examples of the implementation of these methods at treatment facilities around the world. Finally, the clinical dosimetry of proton beams is summarized and sample data are presented. [References: 84]
