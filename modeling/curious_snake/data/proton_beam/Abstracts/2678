Electron energy spectra and angular distributions, including angular spreads, were measured using magnetic spectrometer techniques, at isocenter, for two clinical linear accelerators: one scanning beam machine, which achieves field flatness by scanning a pencil beam over the desired field at the patient plane, and one scattering foil machine, which disperses the electrons through a graded-thickness scattering foil. All measurements were made at isocenter (in the patient plane), in air, 1 m from the nominal accelerator source. The energy measurements were confined to electrons traveling along the central axis; any widely scattered electrons were effectively neglected. The energy spectra of the scanning beam machine are all of nearly Gaussian shape and energy full-width-at-half-maximum intensity (FWHM) of about 5% of the peak mean energy (denoted (E0)*). The energy spectra of the scattering foil machine have a variety of forms as a function of energy, including even spectra with double peaks, and spectra which changed with time. The FWHM values ranged from 9%-22% of (E0)*. The angular spread measurements, at isocenter, yielded sigma theta (x) x (E0)* approximately 295 mrad-MeV for the scanning beam machine, and 346 mrad-MeV for the scattering foil machine, where sigma theta x denotes the standard deviation of the plane-projected angular distribution. These angular spreads are 30%-40% smaller than angular spreads reported by others on a very similar machine using the penumbra method. Possible causes of this discrepancy are discussed
