Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a bimodal radiation therapy used primarily for highly malignant gliomas. Tissue-equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) microdosimetry has proven an ideal dosimetry technique for BNCT, facilitating accurate separation of the photon and neutron absorbed dose components, assessment of radiation quality and measurement of the BNC dose. A miniature dual-TEPC system has been constructed to facilitate microdosimetry measurements with excellent spatial resolution in high-flux clinical neutron capture therapy beams. A 10B-loaded TEPC allows direct measurement of the secondary charged particle spectrum resulting from the BNC reaction. A matching TEPC fabricated from brain-tissue-equivalent plastic allows evaluation of secondary charged particle spectra from photon and neutron interactions in normal brain tissue. Microdosimetric measurements performed in clinical BNCT beams using these novel miniature TEPCs are presented, and the advantages of this technique for such applications are discussed
