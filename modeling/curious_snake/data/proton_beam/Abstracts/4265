The authors presented data on cytogenetic analysis of lymphocytes from human peripheral blood, irradiated at the stage G0 and G2 of the cellular cycle. There was an increase of chromosomal aberrations with an increase of the dose. Furthermore the irradiation at stage G0 caused the formation of aberrations of chromosomal type, but irradiation at stage G2-aberrations of chromatid type. The increase of one-blow aberrations were of linear character at both stages
