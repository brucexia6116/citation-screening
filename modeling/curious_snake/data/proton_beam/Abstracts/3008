Several designs of electronic portal imaging systems for radiotherapy have been reported or are now commercially available, as well as the familiar radiographic screen-film combinations. In order to evaluate imaging performance of these, and future, systems a prototype contrast-detail test object has been developed in conjunction with a method for determining contrast from a model of the X-ray spectra produced by linear accelerators. Several existing test objects rely on qualitative or semi-quantitative estimates of contrast. In this technique, quantitative estimates of contrast may be determined for each detail size from realistic estimates of the X-ray spectrum by using a spectral model either in conjunction with narrow-beam attenuation measurements on the linear accelerator used, or by using the nominal value of maximum photon energy. This technique should facilitate the comparison of imaging systems used with linear accelerators of different energies as well as providing a quantitative quality control tool for regular measurements of imaging performance. Examples of the use of the test object in the evaluation of several commercial screen-film combinations are given
