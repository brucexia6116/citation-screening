Proton pencil beams in water, in a format suitable for treatment planning algorithms and covering the radiotherapy energy range (50-250 MeV), have been calculated using a modified version of the Monte Carlo code PTRAN. A simple analytical model has also been developed for calculating proton broad-beam dose distributions which is in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo calculations. Radial dose distributions are also calculated analytically and narrow proton pencil-beam dose distributions derived. The physical approximations in the Monte Carlo code and in the analytical model together with their limitations are discussed. Examples showing the use of the calculated set of proton pencil beams as input to an existing photon treatment planning algorithm based on biological optimization are given for fully 3D scanned proton pencil beams; these include intensity modulated beams with range shift and scanning in the transversal plane
