One of the objectives of the ongoing research and development work at the Northeast Proton Therapy Center (NPTC) in Boston is to perform optimized intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) treatments. Such treatments may be delivered by magnetically scanning a narrow proton pencil beam across the target volume, while both the scanning speed and the intensity of the beam are modulated. Localization of the proton dose in space allows one to yield dose distributions that are highly conformal to the target volume, thus minimizing the dose delivered to the surrounding healthy tissue. The aim of the current research is to determine technically optimal and clinically relevant specifications for the scanned beam delivery system, which is being developed in collaboration with Ion Beam Applications (IBA); and to create a link between the treatment planning and the beam delivery. IMPT treatment planning is performed for patient cases treated at the NPTC, with KonRad Pro software developed at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). For the IMPT delivery, the proton intensity maps, optimized for discrete pencil beam spots, need to be translated into continuous scanning patterns. At the same time it is necessary to minimize the discrepancy between the planned and delivered doses which may result from such conversion, as well as from the technical limitations of the delivery system. Possibilities have been investigated for improving the proton dose conformity by optimizing the beam and scanning nozzle parameters, and by taking the specifics and limitations of the system into account in the treatment planning stage
