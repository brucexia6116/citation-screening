Prostate cancer, bladder cancer, renal cancer and testicular cancer are common among urological cancers. The treatment strategy for testicular cancer using chemotherapy has been well established and has been shown to be successful. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy play important roles in multidisciplinary therapy for bladder cancer. Radiotherapy is often used as a radical treatment that is practically equivalent to surgery for prostate cancer. In addition, radiotherapy is useful in cases of bone or brain metastases. In the field of chemotherapy, the development of new agents that would make breakthroughs similar to that of cisplatin is awaited. Taxanes and gemcitabine are good candidates. In the field of radiotherapy, 3D conformal radiation therapy (CRT), which has excellent beam distribution, has recently come into wide use. Moreover, brachytherapy and proton and ion beam therapy are expected to prove useful in prostate cancer therapy. [References: 21]
