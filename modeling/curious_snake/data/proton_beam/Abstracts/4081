An experimental system with a humidified irradiation chamber was developed to investigate the effects of monochromatic synchrotron radiation on cultured mammalian cells (HeLa). The dependence of the sensitivity on the wavelength based on D0 showed a minimum at about 190 nm in the range of 160 to 254 nm
