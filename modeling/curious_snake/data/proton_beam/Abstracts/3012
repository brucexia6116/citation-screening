A modified irradiation technique at a linear accelerator facility for radiation surgery within the brain is described consisting of several moving field irradiations in non-coplanar planes. Using collimated narrow beams, a localization system and special computer programs for precise patient positioning, a high concentration of dose within small, well circumscribed volumes is obtained. Resulting dose distributions were studied experimentally and by calculations. A simple algorithm for treatment planning was developed and based on CT images. Radiation surgery within the brain is now technically feasible at our linear accelerator. Seventeen patients have now been treated
