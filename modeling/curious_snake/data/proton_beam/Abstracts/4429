Since 1972, 102 patients with malignant tumours of low radiosensibility were treated with a combined local hyperthermia-gamma-rays irradiation. Most of the tumours grew superficially and half deeply. Results were analysed with regard to tumour regression, local recurrence and frequency of metastases after treatment. Surprisingly good tumour regression, a low local recurrence rate (11%) and no enhancement of distant metastases were found. Treatment rhythms hat not to be altered. Tissue reactions were extremely low. The combined hyperthermia-radiation treatment has its advantages especially, when ionising radiation of low LET is used
