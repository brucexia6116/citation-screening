The survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme is extremely poor, the 5-year survival rate being almost zero. The cause of failure is almost exclusively local progression of tumor, the remainder is due to complications of treatment. Although this tumor is clearly radiation resistant, there is evidence of a dose response relationship. Using a thin slice CT scan of the entire head of a patient with glioblastoma multiforme, 3-dimensional radiation treatment plans were developed for treatment to a dose of 90 cobalt-Gray-equivalent (CGE). Dose distributions using protons were compared to those using x-rays. The results showed advantages for the proton beam technique. Namely the proton plan irradiated less non-target brain than the x-ray plan; this was especially so in the decrease of coverage of deep-seated structures. The volume of non-target brain that received more than 70 CGE was 175 ml for the x-ray plan and 94 ml for the proton plan. This study indicates that for a subpopulation of patients with glioblastoma multiforme, at least 90 CGE could be delivered with proton beam techniques to the target with only small volumes of normal brain structures receiving more than 70 CGE
