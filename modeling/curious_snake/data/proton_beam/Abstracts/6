BACKGROUND: Macular and juxtapapillary circumscribed choroidal haemangiomas (CCH) have always posed a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Proton beam therapy has been advocated by Zografos and associates as optimal for treating these tumours in this critical region as charged particles have a highly localised and uniform dose distribution. PATIENTS: We present 3 cases of CCH treated with proton beam therapy. Two patients developed radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy, and one had a persistent exudative macular detachment following treatment. CONCLUSION: Our experience with proton therapy of these tumours has been disappointing in preventing radiation optic neuropathy and maculopathy and offers little advantage over external irradiation. The majority of our patients with this condition are now treated with low-dose lens-sparing external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, which has encouraging visual results and is a far more cost-effective option
