The alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) was used to analyze DNA damage induced in human lymphocytes by irradiation with high linear energy transfer (LET) ions. Our aim was to measure DNA breaks and to demonstrate the heterogeneity of the damage levels in a lymphocyte population irradiated with ions of different energies and LETs. Four experiments with heavy ions (Ar, C and U), as well as gamma-ray exposure, were conducted to enable comparisons. We demonstrated that the comet assay is able to assess the variability in DNA damage induced at the single cell level. The amount of DNA damage and its heterogeneity increased with particle fluence and LET, but saturated at high LETs. However, when expressed in terms of the mean dose, gamma-rays were more efficient than most of the ions used. The comet assay also allowed the detection of highly damaged cells (HDC), which were previously described as cells in late apoptotic stages. The rapid emergence of HDC in this study suggests that they were generated following ion irradiation-induced creation of DNA break clusters induced by ion exposure. Another clue was that the proportion of HDC increased with LET and fluence. We hypothesized that the LET threshold observed and the higher efficiency of low-LET radiation might be linked to the impossibility of measuring small DNA fragments in HDC
