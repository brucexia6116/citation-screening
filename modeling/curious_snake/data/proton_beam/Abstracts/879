We examined the potential contribution of irradiated medium on the bystander effect using custom made double-mylar stainless steel rings. Exponentially growing Human-hamster hybrid (AL) cells were plated on either one or both sides of double-mylar dishes 2-4 days before irradiation. One side (with or without cells) was irradiated with alpha particles using the track segment mode of a 4 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator at the Radiological Research Accelerator Facilities of Columbia University. Since alpha particles can only traverse a very limited distance, cells plated on the other side of a medium-filled mylar dish will not be irradiated by the alpha particles. The results of chromosomal aberrations on un-irradiated target cells that were attached to the top mylar layer indicate that the number of chromatid-type aberrations was higher when there was a bottom layer of cells in the medium filled chambers than just medium alone. Furthermore, when transferring the medium from these cell-irradiated dishes to fresh AL cultures, chromatid-type aberrations were produced in the un-irradiated fresh cells. In contrast, medium irradiated in the absence of cells had no effect on chromatid aberrations. These results suggest that certain modulating factors secreted from the irradiated cells on the bottom mylar layer into the medium, induce chromatin damage in the un-irradiated, bystander cells
