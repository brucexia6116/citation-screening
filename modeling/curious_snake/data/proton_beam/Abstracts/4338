From 1962 to 1977, 90 patients with hypopharyngeal cancer were seen in the Academic Hospital in Leuven. Radiotherapy was the primary treatment in 66 patients, actuarial survival was 18% at 5 years and local control 22%. In 22 patients treated with a laryngopharyngectomy and pre- or postoperative radiotherapy, survival was also 18%, but local control was obtained in 51%. No differences in prognosis were demonstrated according to the tumoral stage or nodal status. Metastases were found in 10.5% of irradiated patients and in 14% of patients treated with combined therapy. The frequency of postoperative complications was not increased after surgery for preoperatively irradiated patients. Treatment results in hypopharyngeal cancer remain unfavorable, even with a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. Alternative approaches should be actively investigated to improve local control rates such as the modalities currently under study (high LET, new fractionations, combinations with drugs)
