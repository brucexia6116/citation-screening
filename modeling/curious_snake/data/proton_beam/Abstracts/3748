From 1/87 to 12/88, 20 patients with anatomically or functionally inoperable carcinomas of the esophagus (cT1-3/N0-2/M0-1) were treated by endoluminal Ir-192 HDR brachytherapy (1-3 sessions, each 5-7 Gy) and percutaneous irradiation (50-70 Gy/2 Gy). In 10 cases a bouginage or combined dilatation and retrograde Nd-Yag-laser debulking was done before irradiation. The response of the treatment was documented by endoscopy (degree of stenoses) and symptoms (dysphagia score according to De Meester). In 95% of all cases the degree of stenoses was diminished and an improvement of dysphagia was found in 100%. The mean duration of oral uptake of properly chewed food could be prolonged to 308 days
