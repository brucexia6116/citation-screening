Among the 934 patients with a choroidal melanoma treated in first intention with an accelerated proton beam since 1984, 41 (4.4%) presented an extrascleral extension, of which 11 were located anteriorly and 30 posteriorly. For these 30 cases, the diagnosis was made by B ultrasonography only when the volume of the extension was important, between 20 and 2280 mm3. The Cox model multi-variant analysis was used to study the statistically significant parameters in the development of an extrascleral extension. It appears that the maximal diameter of the intraocular tumor (p = 0.0012), the localisation of the anterior margin (p = 0.0304) and the age of the patients (p = 0.0097) are statistically meaningful. The 4 years' survival, studied with the Kaplan-Meier curves, is estimated at 60% for the patients with extrascleral extension and at 85% for the patients without. These results are similar to those of literature, whatever treatment is chosen (enucleation and radiotherapy, exenteration)
