The authors have developed a radiosurgical technique based on multiple arc irradiations. The target is fixed to the rotational isocenter of a Varian 4 MV linear accelerator. The first irradiation is carried out while the radiating source is rotating on a 100-140 degrees arc. The patient is then rotated around a vertical axis passing through the target, and arc irradiations are repeated in different angular positions. By this technique it is possible to obtain very steep dose gradients at the borders of the target volume. High doses are usually delivered in two shots. 47 patients have been treated so far in a clinical trial that started in November 1982. The paper deals with the preliminary results (more than 6 months' follow-up) obtained in patients affected by nonresectable brain tumors and AVMs
