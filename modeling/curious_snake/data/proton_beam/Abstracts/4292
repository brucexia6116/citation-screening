The results of radiation therapy have been evaluated on the basis of local control of the tumor and reaction of the normal tissues. A scoring system, consisting five steps, was proposed to document the response of the tumor as well as the normal tissue reaction in order to evaluate the effects of irradiation. The results of the studies showed that the scoring system was of value to estimate the response of the tumor and the reaction of the normal tissues developed following irradiation. The radiation tolerance of the cutaneous tissue for fast neurons and for 70 MeV protons was expressed as follows. NSD (n, 30 MeV d-Be) = TD N-0.11 T-0.11 (1) NSD (p, 70 MeV) = TD N-0.20 T-0.11 (2) As to the radiation tolerance of the lung, studies are required to determine the optimal scoring system
