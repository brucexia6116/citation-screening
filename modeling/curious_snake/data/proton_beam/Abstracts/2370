Human cultured cells (EUE) were synchronized by the method of the mitotic harvest and the degree of synchronization, during the first duplication interval, determined by various tests which include growth curves, mitotic index cell-size distributions. Values of synchronization index initially greater than 90% and desynchronization rate of about 2%/hour were evaluated. The survival after 1.75 Gy of 31 MeV protons irradiation shows a sensitive period in the late G1 followed by an increase in radioresistance to a maximum in S
