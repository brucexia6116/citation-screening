Proton beam treatment techniques provide a powerful approach to improving dose distribution (decrease treatment volume towards target volume) and hence increasing dose to target with resultant higher tumor control rates and lesser morbity. To achieve these dose distributions in patients requires use of modern imaging techniques, rigid immobilization systems, confirmation of target position vis a vis the proton beam at each treatment session, treatment planning which feature beam's eye view, displays of uncertainty, dose at each anatomic point, boli based on accurate assessment of density along each pixel, etc. Experience at MGH/MEEI/HCL has yielded a disease-free survival of 78% for patients with chordoma/chondrosarcoma of base of skull. Local control is achieved by 98% of patients treated for choroidal melanoma
