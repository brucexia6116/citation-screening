The Therac-25 is a new 25-MeV linear accelerator manufactured by Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd. The first two units have recently been installed in Toronto, Ontario and Halifax, Nova Scotia. Calculations and measurements of primary and secondary radiation levels were made. Neutron dose-equivalent rates were measured inside and outside the room. The maximum leakage rate at 1 m from the accelerator target was 0.4% Sv per peak photon Gy. The tenth value layer for neutrons from the Therac-25, at the entrance to a one-legged maze was found to be 5.5 cm of polyethylene. Measurements were done to estimate daily technologist exposure due to induced activity in the treatment room
