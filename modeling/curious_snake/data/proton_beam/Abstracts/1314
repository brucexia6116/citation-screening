INTRODUCTION: This retrospective study compared the rate of local recurrence after irradiation of uveal melanoma treated with iodine 125 plaques or proton beam therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Iodine 125 plaques were used to treat all uveal melanomas between the end of 1989 and 1991. Since 1991, we have used iodine plaques for small anterior tumors and proton beam for other tumors. We use a plaque with a larger diameter than the tumor diameter (2-4mm) with a dose of 90Gy at the apex. Proton beam therapy is used for all tumors at the equator or posterior to the equator not thicker than 12mm. The dose given is 60Gy cobalt equivalent in four fractions. For each patient, the initial size and location of the tumor were noted as well as the follow-up each year: the outcome for the eye (local recurrence, ocular conservation, and functional results), the occurrence of metastasis, and survival. A statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between December 1989 and September 1998, 1272 patients were treated: 926 (72.8%) were treated with proton beam irradiation and 346 (27.8%) with iodine 125 plaques. The median follow-up was 5 years (60 months). For the patients treated with proton beam therapy, the mean age was 58 years, the tumor location was anterior to the equator for 3.8%, at the equator for 43.6%, and posterior to the equator for 52.6%. The mean tumor diameter was 13.4mm and the mean tumor thickness was 5.69mm. For the patients treated with iodine 125 plaques, the mean age was 61.5 years. The location of the tumor was anterior to the equator for 34.4%, at the equator for 46.5%, and posterior to the equator for 19.1%. The mean tumor diameter was 11.5mm and the mean tumor thickness was 5.12mm. The recurrence rate was 4% for the proton beam treatment and 3.75% for iodine plaques. There was no statistical difference. DISCUSSION: In the literature, the rate of local recurrence is usually higher with iodine 125 plaques than proton beam therapy. We discuss the risk factors for local recurrence after iodine 125 plaques: tumor diameter, lower dose to the tumor apex and lower dose rate, and posterior location of the tumor. We found a higher mortality rate in patients who presented local recurrence. CONCLUSION: When we use iodine 125 plaques for anterior tumors with the proper dose and dose rate to the apex of the tumor, we do not find more recurrence than with proton beam therapy
