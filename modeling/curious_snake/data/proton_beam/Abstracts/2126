Four techniques for measuring the dose rate from Sr-90 concave eye plaques are presented. The techniques involve calibrating a concave eye plaque against a Sr-90 teletherapy unit using X-Omat film, radiochromic film, black LiF TLD discs and LiF chips. The mean dose rate predicted by these dosimeters is 7.5 cGy s(-1). The dose rate quoted by the manufacturer is 33% lower than this value, which is consistent with discrepancies reported by other authors. Calibration against a 6 MV linear accelerator was also carried out using each of the above dosimetric devices, and appropriate sensitivity correction factors have been presented
