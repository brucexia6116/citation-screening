The rejoining of single-strand breaks induced by alpha-particle and gamma irradiation in plasmid DNA under two scavenging conditions has been compared. At the two scavenger capacities used of 1.5 x 10(7) and 3 x 10(6) s-1 using Tris-HCl as the scavenger, the ratio of single- to double-strand breaks for alpha particles is fivefold less than the corresponding ratios for gamma irradiation. The repair of such radiation-induced single-strand breaks has been examined using a cell-free system derived from human whole-cell extracts. We show that the rejoining of single-strand breaks for both alpha-particle- and gamma-irradiated plasmid is dependent upon the scavenging capacity and that the efficiency of rejoining of alpha-particle-induced single-strand breaks is significantly less than that observed for gamma-ray-induced breaks. In addition, for DNA that had been irradiated under conditions that mimic the cellular environment with respect to the radical scavenging capacity, 50% of alpha-particle-induced single-strand breaks are converted to double-strand breaks, in contrast with only approximately 12% conversion of gamma-ray-induced single-strand breaks, indicating that the initial damage caused by alpha particles is more severe. These studies provide experimental evidence for increased clustering of damage which may have important implications for the induction of cancer by low-level alpha-particle sources such as domestic radon
