We describe a peculiar and relatively rare type of chromosomal rearrangement induced in human peripheral lymphocytes that were ostensibly irradiated in G(0) phase of the cell cycle by accelerated heavy ions, and which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously described. The novel rearrangements which were detected using mFISH following exposure to 500 MeV/nucleon and 5 GeV/n 56Fe particles, but were not induced by either 137Cs gamma rays or 238Pu alpha particles, can alternatively be described as either complex chromatid-isochromatid or complex chromatid-chromosome exchanges. Different mechanisms potentially responsible for their formation are discussed. Copyright 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel
