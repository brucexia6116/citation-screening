Measurements were made in air on the central axis of radiation beams from linear accelerators operating in the energy range from 4 to 18 MV, to determine the magnitude and source of head scattered radiation. Machines of several manufacturers were studied. The data indicate that, except for one unique collimator design, head scatter originates primarily in the flattening filter and is relatively independent of energy and machine
