A set of fluence-to-effective-dose conversion coefficients has been calculated for neutrons with energies <20 MeV using a high-resolution anthropomorphic phantom (Zubal model) and the MCNPX code. The calculation used 13 monodirectional monoenergetic neutron beams in the energy range 10(-9) to 20 MeV, under three different source irradiation configurations: anterior-posterior, posterior-anterior and left lateral. Dose calculations were performed for 18 selected organs of the body, for which the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the International Commission on Radiological Units and Measurements have set tissue weighting factors for the determination of the effective dose. Another set of neutron-fluence-to-effective-dose conversion coefficients was also calculated with the proposed modification wR from ICRP Publication 92. From comparison between the dose results calculated and the data reported for the MIRD and VIPMAN models, it can be concluded that, although some discrepancies exist between the Zubal model and the two other models, there is good agreement in the left lateral irradiation geometry
