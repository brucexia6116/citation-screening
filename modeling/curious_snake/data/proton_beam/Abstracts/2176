A novel treatment for two patients with mycosis fungoides involving all or most of the skin surface of the head is described using large overlapping low energy electron beams. Shielding of previously treated and uninvolved areas was achieved by encapsulating cerrobend within a thermoplastic shell in one patient. In the other patient, GE Saturnes unique asymmetric electron field definition facility was used. Satisfactory dose uniformity was demonstrated by the computation of dose distributions on the full summed electron pencil beam model on the Target Series 2 treatment planning system. Verification of the calculated dose homogeneity was confirmed with lithium fluoride (TLD-100) thermoluminescent dosimetry. The relatively simple treatment set-up was accomplished easily on a routine basis and was well tolerated by the patients, both of whom have been in complete remission since their treatment
