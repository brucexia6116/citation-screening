35 patients with somatotropic adenoma of hypophysis were examined before proton therapy and within 3 years after the treatment. High initial level of alpha 1-antitrypsin(alpha 1-AT) and alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2-MG) in the patients blood plasma as well as a decrease in alpha 1-AT activity in cerebrospinal fluid were observed. Within a year after the proton hypophysectomy activity of the proteinase inhibitors returned to the normal values in blood and cerebrospinal fluid simultaneously with clinical restoration and a decrease in content of growth hormone; their level were maintained at normal values within the last two years of observation. Estimation of alpha 1-At activity in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid might be used as an additional test in evaluation of the treatment course in the patients with somatotropic adenoma of hypophysis
