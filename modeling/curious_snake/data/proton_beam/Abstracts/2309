This work considers the problems associated in megavoltage x-ray dosimetry concepts with the current techniques used for normalizing the various dose parameters. The depth of transient charged particle equilibrium (CPE) is introduced as the optimum choice of the normalization point. Properties of this depth are discussed and its uniqueness as a measure of beam quality is illustrated
