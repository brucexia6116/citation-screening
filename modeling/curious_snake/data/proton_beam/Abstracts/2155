The application of synchrotron radiation in medical research has become a mature field of research at synchrotron facilities worldwide. In the relatively short time that synchrotrons have been available to the scientific community, their characteristic beams of UV and X-ray radiation have been applied to virtually all areas of medical science which use ionizing radiation. The ability to tune intense monochromatic beams over wide energy ranges differentiates these sources from standard clinical and research tools. At the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), a major research facility is operational on an advanced wiggler radiation beamport, ID17. The beamport is designed to carry out a broad range of research ranging from cell radiation biology to in vivo human studies. Medical imaging programs at ID17 include transvenous coronary angiography, computed tomography, mammography and bronchography. In addition, a major research program on microbeam radiation therapy is progressing. This paper will present a very brief overview of the beamline and the imaging and therapy programs.
