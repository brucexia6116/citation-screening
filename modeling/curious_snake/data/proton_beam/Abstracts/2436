Various methods for therapy of Icenko-Cushing's disease: radiotherapeutic, surgical and medicinal were evaluated. A total of 184 patients were treated. The authors have been of opinion that therapeutic methods depended on function of the neuroendocrine system and adrenal cortex, e. g. reserpine used after gamma-therapy alone or in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy increased the efficacy of therapy and reduced the time of remission. Parlodel used alone or in combination with chloditan could be used in therapy of early forms of the disease in young patients. Transsphenoidal adenomectomy and proton beam therapy of the hypophysis were recommended in hypophysial adenomas. Proton beam therapy of the hypophysis was an effective method for therapy of patients with diffuse hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and could be used in diffuse nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex in combination with unilateral adrenalectomy
