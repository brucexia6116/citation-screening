Both the design considerations and the dosimetric properties of the Siemens Model 5800 linear accelerator are discussed. This unit is of such an energy (3.3 MV) as to imitate Cobalt-60 teletherapy depth doses. A linear relation of dmax to depth dose at low energies was found for various wave guides and targets. The energy of the unit can be characterized by its nominal accelerating potential of 2.70 MV, its d80 of 5.3 cm, its first half-value layer of 0.8 cm lead and the measured energy of the electron beam at 3.3 MeV. The following selected commissioning aspects are reported: central axis depth dose, relative output factors, beam profiles, wedge factors, virtual source position, back scatter factors, penumbra and build-up region
