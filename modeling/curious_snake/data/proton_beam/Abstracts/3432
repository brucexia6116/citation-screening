In carcinoma of the vulva radical vulvectomy and lymphadenectomy are the treatments of choice if general, condition of the patient size and site of tumor are apt for surgery. The alternative method in high risk patients is a combination of surgical and radiotherapeutic treatment like electrocoagulation, resection, and radiation of the lymph vessels or electroresection and local electron-radiation at the surgically exposed area as well as inguinal and iliacal telecobalt treatment of the lymphnodes sometimes combined with selective lymphadenectomy. Radiation therapy itself as primary treatment seems to be inferior to other methods. The interstitial radiation treatment is only indicated in recurrencies or small tumors which are located in regions which are difficult to reach by surgery. [References: 48]
