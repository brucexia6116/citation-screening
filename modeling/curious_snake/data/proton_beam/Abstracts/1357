Clinical trials of carbon beam radiotherapy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLL), and their results, are briefly described. The local control rate, cause-specific and overall survival rates of 146 patients with clinical stage I NSCLC were 82.0%, 59.0% and 59.0%, respectively. Radiation pneumonia was not serious and infrequent (2.1%). In the phase II clinical study, the local control rate of 50 patients was 100% without radiation pneumonia, resulting in a 74.0% overall survival rate. Carbon beam therapy could be an alternative to surgery, especially for lung cancer patients of advanced age and/or with complications. For locally advanced lung cancer treated with carbon beams, excellent local control as in stage I NSCLC has been demonstrated, providing hopeful prospects for the treatment of lung cancer
