Ocular melanoma is frequently treated using brachytherapy implants (such as 125I and 60Co plaques or 184Ta wire), surgery, or external beam radiotherapy using small 60Co beams, high energy x-rays, or proton therapy. The last technique, though very expensive, provides improved dose distributions and dose localizations in the treatment of tumours adjacent to critical normal tissues. The technique of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is now being used at an increasingly large number of centers in the treatment of lesions in the brain, and the head and neck. This article describes the successful extension of the stereotactic technique to the treatment of ocular melanoma: an eye fixation aid is attached to a noninvasive, relocatable Gill-Thomas-Cosman head frame together with a simple eye-movement tracking system. 2003 American College of Medical Physics
