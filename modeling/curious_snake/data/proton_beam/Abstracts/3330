Total-skin electron irradiation (TSEI) is effective and frequently used in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A treatment technique has been developed at our center, using the Philips SL 75/10 linear accelerator. In our method, the patient is irradiated in a recumbent position by five pairs of uncollimated electron beams at a source to skin distance of 150 cm. This method provides a practical solution to clinical requirements with respect to uniformity of electron dose and low X-ray contamination. Its implementation does not require special equipment or modification of the linear accelerator, 19 of 23 patients (83%) with mycosis fungoides, treated by this method, achieved complete regression of their cutaneous lesions.
