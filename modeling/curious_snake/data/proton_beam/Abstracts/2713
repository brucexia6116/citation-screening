In a retrospective analysis, 42 patients with malignant primary tumor of the parotid gland were evaluated considering survival, local recurrence and tolerance of treatment. All patients referred to radiotherapy were treated by electron beam (10-15 MeV) and followed for more than 5 years. Postoperative radiotherapy after radical operation, with no macroscopic disease, was performed in 18 patients, 7 of whom were treated by radical re-operation and radiation of a recurrent parotid neoplasm. In these groups, the local recurrence rate was 4/18 (22%) and 2/7 (29%), the 5-year survival rate was 9/18 (50%) and 5/7 (71%). In 17 patients, radiotherapy started with gross tumor left behind. This group showed a local recurrence rate of 10/17 (59%) and a 5-year survival of 7/17 (41%). Treatment was well tolerated with no major sequelae. Local tumor control and its impact on survival is discussed
