Based on quantitation of chromosome anomalies observed following in vitro irradiations of human lymphocytes, RGE values were derived for 50 Me V protons relative to 180 kV X-rays. These values indicated 50 Mc V protons to be generally of similar efficiency as X-rays in producing chromosome anomalies in human lymphocytes. However, detailed analysis by types of anomalies observed yielded different RGE values. Thus, 50 Me V protons were found to be 15 percent less efficient than X-rays in producing two-break exchange type aberrations. And inversely, they were about 15 percent more efficient in producing onebread types of aberrations
