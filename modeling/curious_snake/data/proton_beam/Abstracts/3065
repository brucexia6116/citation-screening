A fast neutron therapy facility has been established utilizing the classical solid-pole cyclotron of the National Accelerator Centre (CSIR) in Pretoria. The neutron field is generated from the 9Be(d,n)10B reaction using 16 MeV deuterons on a thick target, yielding 0.51 cGy.min-1.microA-1 at an SSD of 135 cm. Essentially the beam characteristics concur with those measured at other centres with comparable energies
