On-line electronic portal imaging devices are beginning to come into clinical service in support of radiotherapy. A variety of technologies are being explored to provide real-time or near real-time images of patient anatomy within x-ray fields during treatment on linear accelerators. The availability of these devices makes it feasible to verify treatment portals with much greater frequency and clarity than with film. This article reviews the physics of high-energy imaging and describes the operation principles of the electronic portal imaging devices that are under development or are beginning to be used clinically.
