A software program, Peridose, is described to allow easy calculation of the peripheral dose (PD), the dose outside the target area. The calculation is based on published data from many authors, distinguishes between orthogonal and tangential beams and accounts for the use of wedges and shielding blocks. The separate contributions of leakage radiation and collimator scatter to the total PD are calculated too
