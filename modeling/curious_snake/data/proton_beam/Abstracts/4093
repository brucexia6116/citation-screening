The use of a digital camera to simulate irregularly shaped electron treatment fields was investigated. The simulation of electron treatment fields, drawn on patient's skin or shell, is required to fabricate cerrobend inserts for defining the beam apertures. The use of the digital camera made the procedure very easy and time efficient, which was essential for patient comfort as well. The mathematical formulism and accessories required to use the camera for simulating the electron treatment fields are described in detail
