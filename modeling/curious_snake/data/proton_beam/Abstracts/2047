Coronary cineangiography using synchrotron radiation is anticipated, owing to the high intensity and availability of monoenergy. To investigate allowable dose levels in clinical application, absorbed dose distribution in a tissue substitute phantom for a conventional x-ray machine was measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters at the University of Tsukuba under the practical conditions used for digital angiography. The dose rate at a 0.5-cm depth was 0.145 Gy/s, and the dose per frame was 0.725 mGy for the irradiation period of 5 ms per frame. For synchrotron radiation, the dose distribution measurement was made at a 5-GeV AR (Accumulation Ring) of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, in which a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) phantom was irradiated with the strongest beam available at the facility, which was 33.32 keV, 5.2 x 6.2 cm2 beam. Using this beam, a 1-mm-diameter coronary artery has been visualized at 1% iodine concentration at the AR. Nonhomogeneous strength distribution in the beam was observed in the vertical direction. The maximum dose rate was 0.556 Gy/s, and it attenuated to 1/3000 at a 30-cm depth in the beam center. At the deep positions, the doses were influenced by the high harmonics, which was confirmed with an EGS4 Monte Carlo calculation. Outside the beam, beam contamination on both sides of the main beam affected the doses. For comparison to the x-ray machine, the measured dose was analytically converted to that needed for a 5.2 x 16 cm2 beam that is used for clinical application. The dose rate at 0.5-cm depth was found to be 0.215 Gy/s, which is 1.48 times larger than that for x-rays. Moreover, the attenuation rate in the phantom was significantly greater than that of the x-ray machine, because of the difference of the energy spectra between the x-rays and synchrotron radiation used
