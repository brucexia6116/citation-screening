To better understand cellular responses in human lymphoblastoid cell TK6 after exposure to C-ion (22 keV/micrometer) and Fe-ion (1000 keV/micrometer), both protein induction and cell-cycle progression have been extensively analyzed by the recently developed techniques. While proceeding this line of analyses, we realized the importance of studying low-dose effect, in relation to the genetic alterations. Adaptive response by 5~20 cGy of such C- or Fe-ion irradiation to both lethal and mutagenic effects of the challenging X-ray exposure (1~3 Gy) was difficult to be seen in this TK6 cells, but surprisingly, a relatively high level of p53 and its related proteins induction was observed after low-dose irradiations of heavy-ions. Here, we focus to introduce the above results of genetic and biochemical studies to elucidate the adaptive response. c2001 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved
