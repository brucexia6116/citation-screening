To initiate Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) in our department, theoretical cases were used as a training, to define methods of measurements and to verify the software by comparing results of calculation and measurement on a PMMA phantom. Irradiation was performed with 6 and 25 MV X-rays from a linear accelerator. For measurements, films and ionization chambers have been chosen. The comparison between calculations and measurements shows some discrepancies at the level of junctions and also in areas of low doses especially when many segments were used. These theoretical cases provide a first step on the way towards treatments with intensity modulation
