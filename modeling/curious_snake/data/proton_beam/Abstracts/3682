The dose distribution within the patient was studied with 8-MeV bremsstrahlung from a linear accelerator during mantle field irradiation using molded shielding blocks. Doses and dose distributions in the different layers of a modified Alderson phantom were measured by means of film dosimetry and related to the dose in the central ray beam at the middle of the body. Dose distribution within unshielded regions perpendicular to the central ray beam generally being relatively homogeneous, the highest relative doses, amounting to ca. 115%, are found in the region of the mandibular angle and in the supraclavicular region; the dose to superficial lymph nodes at the supraclavicular region reaches 100% of the dose in the central ray beam. As a cause for these important doses near the surface of the body are discussed the extension of mantle fields as well as the increased exit dose of the opposed field and the oblique incidence of radiation
