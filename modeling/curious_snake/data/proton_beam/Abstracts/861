Intensity modulated, active beam delivery, like magnetic raster scanning, strongly relies on target immobilisation. If target motion cannot be avoided, interferences between the scanning procedure and the tumour displacement destroy the volume conformity. A prototype setup for 3D online motion compensation (3D-OMC) with a scanned particle beam is described, transferring the full potential of volume conformal irradiation to moving targets
