PURPOSE: To analyse the cell inactivation frequencies induced by low energy protons in human cells with different sensitivity to photon radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four human cell lines with various sensitivities to photon irradiation were used: the SCC25 and SQ20B derived from human epithelium tumours of the tongue and larynx, respectively, and the normal lines M/10, derived from human mammary epithelium, and HF19 derived from a lung fibroblast. The cells were irradiated with y-rays and proton beams with linear energy transfer (LET) from 7 to 33 keV/microm. Clonogenic survival was assessed. RESULTS: Survival curves are reported for each cell line following irradiation with gamma-rays and with various proton LETs. The surviving fraction after 2 Gy of gamma-rays was 0.72 for SQ20B cells, and 0.28-0.35 for the other cell lines. The maximum LET proton effectiveness was generally greater than that of gamma-rays. In particular there was a marked increase in beam effectiveness with increasing LET for the most resistant cells (SQ20B) whose 2 Gy-survival varied from 0.72 with gamma-radiation down to 0.37 with 30 keV/microm protons. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE(2 Gy gamma)) with the 30 keV/microm beam, evaluated as the ratio of 2 Gy to the proton dose producing the same inactivation level as that given by 2 Gy of gamma-rays, was 3.2, 1.8, 1.3 and 0.8 for SQ20B, M/10, SCC25, and HF19, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: RBE for inactivation with high-LET protons increased with the cellular radioresistance to gamma-rays. The cell line with the greatest resistance to gamma-rays was the most responsive to the highest LET proton beam. A similar trend has also been found in studies reported in the literature with He, C, N ions with LET in the range 20-125 keV/microm on human tumour cell lines
