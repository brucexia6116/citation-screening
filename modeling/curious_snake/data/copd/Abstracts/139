Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine up-regulated by rhinovirus infection during acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The role of IL-6 during exacerbations is unclear; however, it is believed IL-6 could contribute to airway and systemic inflammation. In this study we investigate the effects of common asthma treatments fluticasone propionate and beta(2) agonists salmeterol and salbutamol on IL-6 production in BEAS-2B and primary bronchial epithelial cells. Salmeterol and salbutamol enhanced rhinovirus- and IL-1beta-induced IL-6 production; however, fluticasone treatment caused a reduction of IL-6 protein and mRNA. Combined activity of salmeterol and fluticasone at equimolar concentrations had no effect on rhinovirus or IL-1beta induction of IL-6. The induction of IL-6 by salmeterol was dependent upon the beta(2) receptor and could also be induced by cAMP or cAMP-elevating agents forskolin and rolipram. Using transfection of IL-6 promoter reporter constructs, dominant negative mutants, and electromobility shift assays, it was found that NF-kappaB was the only transcription factor required for rhinovirus induction of IL-6 gene expression. Salmeterol caused an augmentation of rhinovirus-induced promoter activation via a mechanism dependent upon the c/EBP and/or CRE (cyclic AMP response element) cis-acting sites. The suppressive effect of FP was dependent upon distinct glucocorticoid response element sequences proximal to the transcriptional start site within the IL-6 promoter. The data demonstrate that beta(2) agonists can augment IL-6 expression by other stimuli in an additive manner via cyclic AMP and that the negative effect of steroids is mediated by glucocorticoid response elements within the IL-6 promoter
