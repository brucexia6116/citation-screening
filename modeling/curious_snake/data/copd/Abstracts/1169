Unexplained weight loss is common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Since leptin, an obesity gene product, is known to play important roles in the control of body weight and energy expenditure, we investigated serum leptin levels, along with circulating tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and soluble TNF receptor (sTNF-R55 and -R75) levels, in 31 patients with COPD and 15 age-matched healthy controls. The body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat (%fat) were significantly lower in the COPD patients than in the healthy controls (BMI = 18.1 +/- 2.7 kg/m2 versus 22.8 +/- 2.2 kg/m2 [mean +/- SD]; p < 0.0001; %fat = 16.9 +/- 5.8% versus 24.3 +/- 4.9%; p < 0.001). Serum leptin levels were significantly lower in the COPD patients than in the healthy controls (1.14 +/- 1.17 ng/ml versus 2.47 +/- 2.01 ng/ml; p < 0.05). In contrast, serum TNF-alpha levels (6.59 +/- 1.92 pg/ml versus 5.41 +/- 1.60 pg/ml; p < 0.05), plasma sTNF-R55 (1.16 +/- 0.47 ng/ml versus 0.67 +/- 0.13 ng/ml; p < 0.0001) and sTNF-R75 (3.65 +/- 1.29 ng/ml versus 2.25 +/- 0.43 ng/ml; p < 0.0001) levels were significantly higher in the COPD patients than in the healthy controls. Importantly, circulating leptin levels (log transformed) did correlate well with BMI and %fat, but not with TNF-alpha or with sTNF-R levels in the COPD patients. These data suggest that circulating leptin is independent of the TNF-alpha system and is regulated physiologically even in the presence of cachexia in patients with COPD
