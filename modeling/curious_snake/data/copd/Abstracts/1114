Severe alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, phenotype Pi ZZ, is a rare condition with an estimated prevalence of 1/4500 individuals in Spain. Given this low prevalence, it seems useful to accumulate all the information derived from the care of these patients. In this context, the Spanish Registry of patients with AAT deficiency was founded in 1993; its main objectives were to establish guidelines adapted to our country for the treatment and management of AAT-deficient patients, offer expert support to physicians all over the country treating these patients, and provide technical support on the determination of Pi phenotyping and genotyping of individuals suspected of being AAT-deficient. From 1993 to January 1998 the number of enrollees increased from 48 to 223, of which 216 were Pi ZZ. Seventy-three per cent were male and only 31.5% were never smokers, mean age was 46 years (SD = 13 years) and mean FEV1 53% predicted (SD = 31%). 83% were index cases who, compared with non-index cases, were older (49 +/- 11 vs. 35 +/- 13 years, P < 0.001), more likely to have a smoking history (85% vs. 47%, P < 0.01) and displayed more severe impairment in pulmonary function (FEV1% = 40% +/- 19% vs. 96% +/- 23%, P < 0.001). Augmentation therapy was administered to 129 patients (58%). Treated patients had more severe impairment in pulmonary function than the untreated (FEV1% = 40% +/- 21% vs. 72% +/- 32%, P < 0.001) and were more likely to be index cases (81% vs. 43%, P < 0.001). Characteristics of the patients included are similar to those described for other Registries. The Registry has extended knowledge of the disease throughout the country and has established local guidelines for treatment and follow-up. It may be a valid database for future co-operation in international initiatives
