Branhamella catarrhalis causes lower respiratory tract infections in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The outer membrane protein CD (OMP-CD) of B. catarrhalis is a major, heat-modifiable OMP. The goals of this study are to characterize the degree of conservation of OMP-CD among strains and to investigate if OMP-CD maintains its homogeneity under the effect of host immune selective pressure. Isolates of B. catarrhalis were collected prospectively from patients with bronchiectasis and chronic bronchitis. We studied the OMP-CD gene by analysis of PCR restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) and further determined DNA sequence of the CD gene of eight selected isolates. Five patterns of PCR-RFLP of the OMP-CD gene were observed among all isolates when the gene was digested with Sau3AI. The sequence analysis revealed a high degree of homogeneity in OMP-CD among strains of B. catarrhalis. Three regions of OMP-CD with minimal sequence heterogeneity were identified. The sequences of the OMP-CD gene of isolates collected from patients colonized with the same strain for up to 6 months was identical. These observations establish that the OMP-CD of B. catarrhalis recovered from clinical isolates is highly conserved among strains
