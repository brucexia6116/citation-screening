BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that emphysematous lungs are characterized by an increase in the numbers of neutrophils, macrophages, and CD8+ T lymphocytes, the lasts having increased cytotoxic activity. Because systemic inflammation is also a component of emphysema, we hypothesize that peripheral CD8+ T lymphocytes of emphysematous smokers who show evidence of systemic inflammation will have higher expression of cytotoxic molecules. METHODS: We assessed parameters of systemic inflammation in normal individuals (smokers or non-smokers) and in emphysematous subjects with an active smoking history by measuring serum interleukine-6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor. Expression of perforin, granzyme B, and FasL protein by CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD4+ T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells were assessed by flow cytometry while perforin, granzyme B, and FasL mRNA expression were measured on purified systemic CD8+ T lymphocytes by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Emphysematous smokers had higher levels of serum interleukine-6 than normal subjects. Even with the presence of systemic inflammation in emphysematous smokers, the percentage of peripheral CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD4+ T lymphocytes, and NK cells expressing perforin and granzyme B protein was not different between the three groups. CONCLUSION: Despite evidence of systemic inflammation, peripheral T lymphocytes of emphysematous smokers did not show higher levels of cytotoxic markers, suggesting that increase of activated T lymphocytes in the emphysematous lung may be due to either activation in the lung or specific peripheral recruitment
