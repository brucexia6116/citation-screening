Cancer can be associated with hematological complications related to red blood cell (RBC) function, whose physiological roles have now been expanded since it is now known that RBC are also signalling cells. The aim of this study was to explore the alterations occurring in the protein composition of RBC in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Blood samples from 21 patients with advanced (stages III-IV) NSCLC (16 squamous cell carcinomas and 5 adenocarcinomas), and from 21 healthy volunteers were used. Samples from 6 randomly selected patients and 6 controls were used for the screening of erythrocyte ghost alterations by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Samples from 15 patients and 15 controls, different from those used in the DSC measurements, were randomly selected for analysis of the expression of glycophorin (GP) species, band 3, and glycoproteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting or lectin enzyme immunoassays. Additionally, 5 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were used as a control group representative of a benign inflammatory disease. Blood samples from the COPD patients were used to analyze the expression of GPs, band 3 and syaloglycoproteins. We observed the following in NSCLC: (a) changes in GP expression levels, mainly decreases in the GPA and GPC monomers, and in the GPAB dimers; (b) a decrease in the band 3 protein level, and (c) alterations in the expression of different sialoglycoproteins. RBC from the COPD patients also showed protein abnormalities, some of them, especially at the level of band 3 and the syaloglycoproteins, being similar to those in NSCLC
