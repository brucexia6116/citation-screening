OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of polymorphisms of genes regulating glutathione S-transferase (GST) and its plasma GST activity in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-three patients with stable COPD from several community or regional hospitals were matched for age and pack-years smoked with the same number of health controls from the general population. Each participant underwent an interview-based respiratory and smoking questionnaire, lung function testing and gave a blood sample. Genotyping was carried out using a polymerase chain reaction-based method for polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1), glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) and glutathione S-transferase P 1 (GSTP1) genes. Plasma GST activity was measured using the spectrofluorometric method. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the distribution of various genotypes of polymorphisms of GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 between COPD patients and healthy controls. GST activity was significantly higher in patients compared with controls, irrespective of their different genotypes, and was not different between patients with different levels of airflow obstruction. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms of GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 genes are unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of COPD in Chinese in Hong Kong and Southern China
