Protease-antiprotease imbalance due to genetic variation may be responsible for the development of pulmonary emphysema induced by smoking. Since matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have recently been suggested to play important roles in the pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema, the association between the functional polymorphism of MMP-9 (-1562C/T) and the development of pulmonary emphysema was examined in 110 smokers and 94 nonsmokers in Japan. The T allele frequency was higher in subjects with distinct emphysema on chest CT-scans (n = 45) than in those without it (n = 65) (0.244 vs 0.123, P = 0.02). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the T allele is a risk factor for smoking-induced emphysema (odds ratio = 2.69, P = 0.02). DL(CO)/VA was lower (P = 0.02) and emphysematous changes were more conspicuous (P = 0.03) in subjects with C/T or T/T (n = 35) than in those with C/C (n = 75). These results suggest that the polymorphism of MMP-9 acts as a genetic factor for the development of smoking-induced pulmonary emphysema. Copyright 2001 Academic Press
