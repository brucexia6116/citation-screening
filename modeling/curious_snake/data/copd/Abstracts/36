Streptomyces cinereoruber isolated from a patient with severe respiratory failure that could not be identified by culture was correctly identified at the species level by comparative sequence analysis of 16S rDNA and the hypervariable alpha-region of 16S rDNA. Restriction fragment length polymorphism, morphologic, and biochemical characteristics have confirmed their identity
