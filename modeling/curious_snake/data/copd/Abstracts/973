The transcription factor early growth response (Egr)-1 is an immediate-early gene product rapidly and transiently expressed after acute tissue injury. In contrast, in this report we demonstrate that lung tissue from patients undergoing lung reduction surgery for advanced emphysema, without clinical or anatomical evidence of acute infection, displays a selective and apparently sustained increase in Egr-1 transcripts and antigen, compared with a broad survey of other genes, including the transcription factor Sp1, whose levels were not significantly altered. Enhanced Egr-1 expression was especially evident in smooth muscle cells of bronchial and vascular walls, in alveolar macrophages, and some vascular endothelium. Gel shift analysis with (32)P-labeled Egr probe showed a band with nuclear extracts from emphysematous lung which was supershifted with antibody to Egr-1. Egr-1 has the capacity to regulate genes relevant to the pathophysiology of emphysema, namely those related to extracellular matrix formation and remodeling, thrombogenesis, and those encoding cytokines/chemokines and growth factors. Thus, we propose that further analysis of Egr-1, which appears to be up-regulated in a sustained fashion in patients with late stage emphysema, may provide insights into the pathogenesis of this destructive pulmonary disease, as well as a new facet in the biology of Egr-1
