OBJECTIVE: To clarify the association between the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 genotype with the CYP1A2 phenotype and to search for the CYP1A2*1K haplotype, which has been shown to decrease CYP1A2 inducibility and/or other functional polymorphisms in Japanese. METHODS: Two polymorphisms, CYP1A2*1C and CYP1A2*1F, were genotyped in 126 patients receiving oral slow-release theophylline (TP) therapy and in 224 healthy volunteers. The CYP1A2 phenotype was assessed by the plasma [1-methyluric acid (1U)+3-methylxanthine (3X)]/TP ratio in the patients. The volunteers were given 150 mg caffeine, and the urine [1X+1U+5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil (AAMU)]/17U ratio was used for CYP1A2 phenotyping. CYP1A2 intron 1 and six exons (exon 2-exon 7) were sequenced in the patients whose (1U+3X)/TP ratios were below the mean-2SD of those of all patients, and intron 1 was also sequenced in an additional 20 healthy volunteers exhibiting putative low CYP1A2 activities. RESULTS: The individual (1U+3X)/TP ratios ranged from 0.007 to 0.21 (a 30-fold difference) in the patients, and the (1X+1U+AAMU)/17U ratios ranged from 1.6 to 112 (a 70-fold difference) in the healthy volunteers. The CYP1A2 activities were not significantly influenced by CYP1A2*1C or CYP1A2*1F. We found no functional polymorphisms by a sequencing analysis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the CYP1A2*1C and CYP1A2*1F genotypes are not crucial factors for the variability of CYP1A2 activity and that the CYP1A2*1K haplotype is either nil or only shows a very low frequency in Japanese
