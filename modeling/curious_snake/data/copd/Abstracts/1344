Data on forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second and peak expiratory flow rate were obtained in a group of 588 healthy and well-nourished (but not obese) Bangladeshi teenagers to establish normal values in this population. Bangladeshi girls in their early teens showed higher peak expiratory flow rates than boys of the same age but while this continued to rise in boys after the age of 15 years the peak expiratory flow rate in girls seemed to have attained its maximum values by that age. Correlations between sitting height and the lung function variables were found to be marginally greater than those with standing height. Prediction equations were calculated for each lung function variable with sitting and standing separately. Comparison of the results in our study with those reported from other ethnic groups indicate that Bangladeshi values are lower than those of Europeans, Jordanians or Chinese but not significantly different from those reported for Libyans. Since in practice, genetic, nutritional and environmental factors are not readily disentangled, norms for a given study population need to be derived from healthy subjects of similar background and ethnicity
