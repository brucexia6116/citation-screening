alpha 1-Antitrypsin is a major plasma protease inhibitor synthesized in the liver. Genetic deficiency of this protein predisposes the affected individuals to development of infantile liver cirrhosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary emphysema. The human chromosomal alpha 1-antitrypsin gene has been cloned and shown to contain three introns in the peptide-coding region. When the cloned alpha 1-antitrypsin gene was used as a hybridization probe to analyze Eco RI-digested genomic DNA from different individuals, two distinct bands of 9.6 kilobases (kb) and 8.5 kb in length were observed in every case. Further analysis using only labeled intronic DNA as the hybridization probe has indicated that the authentic alpha 1-antitrypsin gene resides within the 9.6-kb fragment. Thus the 8.5-kb fragment must contain another gene that is closely related in sequence to the alpha 1-antitrypsin gene. Using a series of human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids containing unique combinations of human chromosomes, the alpha 1-antitrypsin gene as well as the sequence-related gene have been assigned to human chromosome 14 by Southern hybridization and synteny analysis
