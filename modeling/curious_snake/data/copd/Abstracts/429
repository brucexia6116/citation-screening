OBJECTIVE: Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is a progressive inflammatory disease, well recognized in Japan, that is characterized by chronic sinusitis and obstructive small airway disease. A total of 40 patients with DPB in mainland China were reviewed in order to describe the epidemiology of DPB in China and to compare their clinical characteristics with those of cases reported in Japan. METHODOLOGY: A systematic search was conducted of the Chinese language literature published in mainland China from 1996 to 2003. The 40 subjects who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for DPB were retrospectively analysed for clinical, physiological, radiological, and pathological features and their geographic distribution. RESULTS: The 40 patients included in this study (31 male and nine female) were distributed in 12 provinces and three other cities in China. All presented with chronic cough, sputum production, and 32 had exertional dyspnoea. All but three had a history of sinusitis. Lung function assessment showed a mixed obstructive-restrictive pattern in 30 cases. CXR revealed diffuse fine nodular shadows in all patients. Human leukocyte antigen-B54 was positive in five patients (n = 12). A total of 30 (75%) patients had been misdiagnosed prior to their diagnosis of DPB being made. CONCLUSIONS: DPB is not rare in China but its incidence is relatively low. Poor recognition and/or genetic factors may be the reason. The clinical, radiographic and histological features of Chinese patients resemble those described in Japanese patients
