alpha 2-Macroglobulin (A2M) is a major human plasma protease inhibitor capable of inhibiting most endopeptidases tested so far. In the case of the other major plasma protease inhibitor, alpha 1-antitrypsin, genetically determined deficiency states are known to increase the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 20- to 30-fold in affected individuals. No defects of the A2M gene have been described as yet, but A2M may play a role in the regulation of protease activity in the lung, especially with respect to those proteases not inhibited by alpha 1-antitrypsin. We report here the molecular genetic detection of an alteration of the A2M gene in a patient with serum A2M deficiency and chronic lung disease since childhood. The alteration involves restriction sites detected with 10 different enzymes and is most probably caused by a major deletion or rearrangement of the gene. Nine of the restriction enzymes used detected no polymorphisms in 40 healthy control subjects and 39 COPD patients. The polymorphism detected in this patient with the enzyme PvuII was different from another described previously, and was found in this patient only. The patient is heterozygous for an alteration in the A2M gene; this may be responsible for his serum A2M deficiency and may be relevant to the early onset of pulmonary disease in his case
