A 50-year-old man was found to have 40% of the normal serum alpha1-antitrypsin concentration but subsequent electrofocusing showed a pattern indistinguishable from the ordinary M pattern. This finding and family studies suggested that he was a carrier of a null (-) allele. Heavy smoking and this Pi M- phenotype in interaction probably were responsible for the development of emphysema, documented by an extensive investigation of lung function. Two non-smoking offspring carrying the null allele had normal lung function. Normal karyotypes were found in all the Pi M- subjects
