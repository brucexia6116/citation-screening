Alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) is the major inhibitor of proteinase 3 (PR3), the main target antigen of antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) in Wegener's granulomatosis. alpha 1-AT is encoded by a polymorphic gene, with over 75 alleles, defining severely, medium and non-deficient protease inhibitor (PI) phenotypes. We describe the association of severely and medium deficient PI phenotypes with anti-PR3 positive systemic vasculitis, and postulate a pathogenetic role for alpha 1-AT deficiency and the occurrence of ANCA, with specificity for PR3 in a subgroup of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis
