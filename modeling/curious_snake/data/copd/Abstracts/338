RATIONALE: In normal human lung, single alveolar fibroblasts link capillary endothelium to type 2 pneumocytes through apertures in the endothelial and epithelial basal laminae. These fibroblasts are hypothesized to play a role in cellular communication between the endothelium and epithelium and are positioned to provide leukocytes a surface on which they may migrate through the interstitium. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether fibroblasts link the endothelium to the epithelium in emphysematous lung and to compare basal lamina aperture frequency with previously published results. METHODS: We performed transmission electron microscopy serial section three-dimensional reconstructions of emphysematous regions of human alveolar wall and a quantitative analysis of basal lamina apertures beneath 403 type 2 pneumocytes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our three-dimensional reconstruction demonstrated that the fibroblasts subtending type 2 pneumocytes in emphysematous lung no longer link these epithelial cells to the capillary endothelium through basal lamina apertures. Basal lamina apertures may be absent below some type 2 pneumocytes. Our morphometric analysis showed that their frequency and area beneath type 2 pneumocytes is significantly reduced in emphysematous regions when compared with nonemphysematous regions of matched control lung. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the endothelial/fibroblast/epithelial linkage is disrupted in emphysematous human lungs and postulate this disruption may disturb leukocyte migration and account for their accumulation in the alveolar interstitium of emphysematous lung tissue
