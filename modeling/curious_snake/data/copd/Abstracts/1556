The human protease inhibitor genes alpha 1 antitrypsin (alpha 1-PI) and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (alpha 1-ACT) are acute-phase proteins which are induced in response to inflammation. These inhibitors function to limit the activity of serine proteases in vivo. alpha 1-PI acts as an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase to protect the elastin fibers of the lung. Genetic deficiencies of alpha 1-PI result in development of chronic pulmonary emphysema. The physiologic role of alpha 1-ACT has not been clearly defined, but it also appears to function in the maintenance of protease-protease inhibitor equilibrium in the lung. Nucleic acid and protein sequence homologies detected between alpha 1-PI and alpha 1-ACT suggested an evolutionary relationship. Gene mapping experiments were performed to determine if these protease inhibitor genes reside at the same chromosomal locus in man. In situ hybridization data demonstrate that both alpha 1-PI and alpha 1-ACT map to the same region, q31-q32.3, on chromosome 14
