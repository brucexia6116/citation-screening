BACKGROUND: Previous work has suggested that in addition to environmental influences, there is a genetic predisposition for the development of both asthma and atopy. A subset of asthmatic subjects who are intolerant to aspirin has been identified. A previous study has suggested that there is an association between aspirin sensitivity and HLA-DQw2. METHODS: To further assess this association, we studied two populations of aspirin-sensitive subjects and aspirin-tolerant subjects with asthma. Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and hybridized with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes specific to the second exon of the DRB1, DQA1, DQB1, and DPB1 chains. RESULTS: Using polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes, we have been unable to confirm a significant association between aspirin sensitivity and HLA-DQw2. CONCLUSION: We have shown, however, that there is a significant decrease in the incidence of DPB1*0401 in both aspirin-tolerant and aspirin-intolerant subjects with asthma in both populations studied
