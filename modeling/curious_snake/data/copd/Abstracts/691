RATIONALE: Previously reported linkage to FEV(1) (LOD score = 5.0) on 6q27 in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) led us to explore a candidate gene, SMOC2, at 168.6 Mb. OBJECTIVES: We tested association between SMOC2 polymorphisms and FEV(1) and FVC in unrelated FHS participants. METHODS: Twenty single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around SMOC2 were genotyped in 1,734 subjects. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: SNP data were analyzed using multiple linear regression models incorporating sex, age, body mass index, height, and smoking history as covariates, and analyses were repeated within strata of ever- and never-smokers. The minor allele of SNP rs1402 was associated with higher mean FEV(1) (p = 0.003) and FVC (p = 0.02) measures. In never-smoking subjects, association with higher measures was observed with the minor allele of rs747995 (FEV(1), p = 0.0006; FVC, p = 0.0008). These two SNPs lie in different haplotype blocks and reside in intron 4 of SMOC2. Haplotype analysis revealed a common G-T haplotype (rs747995-rs1402) with 77% frequency in never-smoking FHS subjects. The G-T haplotype was associated with reduction of 126 ml for FEV(1) (p = 0.0002) and 157 ml for FVC (p = 0.0002). The G-T haplotype was similarly associated in a set of never-smoking subjects from the Family Heart Study (FEV(1), p = 0.03; FVC, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The replication of the association in two populations supports the possibility that SMOC2 might play an important role in the determination of FEV(1) and FVC
