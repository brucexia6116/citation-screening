Pulmonary Function Tests(PFTS) are useful in the diagnosis and management of respiratory disorders. They provide an objective and quantitative measure of some aspects of brocho-pulmonary function. For meaningful interpretation of PFTs, an individual's own previous baseline results compared with current results are preferred, but in the absence of such baseline values, standard normograms may be used. Since lung function values are influenced by genetic, environmental, nutritional, and several other factors, it is important for every laboratory to use normograms that reflect these important factors. The results presented here are the first baseline data on pulmonary function (VC, FVC, FEV1, and FEV%) in a wide cross-section of healthy Sierra Leoneans
