The association between alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency and glomerulonephritis has only sporadically been reported, and mostly based upon autopsy findings, as opposed to the more frequent linkage between A1AT deficiency and lung emphysema with or without hepatic cirrhosis. The present case report describes a 30-year-old man with A1AT deficiency, without evidence of lung disease, who developed hepatic cirrhosis in early childhood and IgA glomerulonephritis and hypertension in adult life. The IgA nephritis followed an unusual course, with a sudden deterioration of the renal function, possibly induced by uncontrolled hypertension or the possible occurrence of vasculitis. After 6 months of hemodialysis, the patient successfully underwent living-related-donor kidney transplantation
