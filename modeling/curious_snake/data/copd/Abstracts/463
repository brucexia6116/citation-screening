Emphysema occurs in a subgroup of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and patients with the genetic defect of alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency who have a smoking history of many years' duration. Emphysema is generally the result of a chronic and progressive destruction of the alveolar structures, which is believed to be driven by chronic inflammation, infections, oxidative stress, and an imbalance of protease and antiprotease activity. Here, we use microarray technology to characterize the gene expression profile of lung tissue samples obtained from patients with advanced emphysema and that obtained from healthy subjects. We hypothesized that the gene expression profile of emphysema lung tissue is distinct when compared with the expression profile of normal lungs. We report that severely emphysematous tissue is characterized by a global decrease in gene expression and by an increased abundance of transcripts encoding proteins involved in inflammation, immune responses, and proteolysis. Whereas the gene expression profile is to some degree shared between "usual" emphysema and alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency-related emphysema, there are statistically significant differences in the modulation of groups of genes associated with protein and energy metabolism, and immune function, which allow distinction between these two emphysema types on the lung tissue level
