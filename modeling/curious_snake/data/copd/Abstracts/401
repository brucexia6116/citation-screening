Moraxella catarrhalis is an important cause of respiratory infections in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and of otitis media in children. Outer membrane protein (OMP) G1a is an approximately 29-kDa surface lipoprotein and is a potential vaccine candidate. The gene that encodes OMP G1a was expressed and purified using a novel plasmid vector. [(3)H]palmitic acid labeling demonstrated that both native and recombinant OMP G1a contain covalently bound palmitic acid. To assess the expression of OMP G1a during human infection, paired sera and sputum supernatants from adults with COPD followed prospectively were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with recombinant lipidated OMP G1a to detect antibodies made specifically during carriage of M. catarrhalis. Overall, 23% of patients developed either a serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) response (9%) or sputum IgA response (21%) to OMP G1a, following 100 episodes of acquisition and clearance of M. catarrhalis. Patients developed antibody responses at similar rates following episodes of clinical exacerbation compared to asymptomatic colonization. Serum IgG antibodies following natural infection were directed predominantly at OMP G1a epitopes that are not exposed on the bacterial surface. These data show that OMP G1a is expressed during infection of the human respiratory tract and is a target of systemic and mucosal antibodies. These observations indicate that OMP G1a, a highly conserved surface protein, should be evaluated further as a vaccine candidate
