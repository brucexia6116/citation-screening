The study of the genetic epidemiology of airways obstruction has suggested that not only is COPD the prototype of a multifactorial disorder in which many factors contribute to the risk of its occurrence, but also that its definitive characteristic--impaired pulmonary function--may be a multi-disease factor which acts as a key component or cofactor in a number of other disorders: a common route to multiple and diverse pathological manifestations. Further evidence is needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis both of multiple possible causes and, especially, of multiple potential effects of airways obstruction. In view of the implications of such causes and effects, we look to continuing research to obtain and analyze a variety of appropriate data to evaluate further the validity of the hypothesis presented
