We have examined age-related changes in the association between nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and atopy in 494 second-generation Polynesian migrant children, aged 5 to 15 years. BHR (provocative dose of methacholine, less than or equal to 7.8 mumol, causing a 20% fall in FEV1) was present in 125 children (25.3%). Atopy (skin wheal, greater than or equal to 4 mm diameter) was present in 157 children (32%). BHR associated with atopy demonstrated a constant age-related frequency in the 7- to 15-year-old children that was influenced by a family history (FH) of asthma (FH, 50%; no FH, 34%; p = 0.051). BHR not associated with atopy demonstrated a marked decreasing frequency with age from 25% in 5- to 7-year-old children to 3% in 13- to 15-year-old children and was uninfluenced by an FH of asthma. We conclude that the differences in the frequency of BHR with age, together with the genetic influence on BHR associated with atopy, compared with the findings in nonatopic children, indicate distinct heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of BHR in these Tokelauan children. These differences may be important for understanding the relationships between nonspecific BHR, atopy, and asthma in children
