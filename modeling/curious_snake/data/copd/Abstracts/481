Whether surfactant protein B (SP-B)-18A/C and 1580C/T polymorphism were associated with susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Chinese Han population was investigated. After genomic DNA was isolated from blood of COPD smokers and control smokers, the genotypes of SP-B-18A/C and SP-B1580C/T polymorphism loci were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP) respectively. The results showed that there was significant difference in genotypes distribution frequency of SP-B1580C/T polymorphism locus between COPD smokers and control smokers. C-->T mutation rate (including TT homozygote and CT heterozygote) in COPD smokers was higher than in control smokers (57.9% vs 41.7%, chi2 = 4.93, P<0.05), whereas there was no significant difference in genotypes distribution frequency of SP-B1580-18A/C locus between COPD smokers and control smokers. The allele frequency (29.1%) of SP-B1580-18A/C locus is lower than T allele (70.9%) in Chinese Han Population, and the distribution was different from that in Mexican, in which, the A and T allele frequencies were 85% and 15% respectively. It was concluded that SP-B1580 T allele was probably associated with increased susceptibility to COPD in Chinese Han population; The polymorphism of SP-B-18A/C locus maybe varied with race
