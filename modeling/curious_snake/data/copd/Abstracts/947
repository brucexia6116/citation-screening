OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to estimate the strength of association between chronic bronchitis and lifetime exposure to occupational factors, current lifestyle, and the NS-phenotype in the MNS blood group among middle aged and elderly men. METHODS: The study was carried out within the frameworks of the Copenhagen Male Study. Of 3387 men 3331 men with a mean age of 63 (range 53-75) years could be classified by prevalence of chronic bronchitis. As well as the completion of a large questionnaire on health, lifestyle, and working conditions, all participants had a thorough examination, including measurements of height and weight and blood pressure and a venous blood sample was taken for the measurement of serum cotinine and MNS typing; 16.5% of the men had the NS-phenotype. Chronic bronchitis was defined as cough and phlegm lasting 3 months or more for at least 2 years; 14.6% had chronic bronchitis. RESULTS: Smoking and smoke inhalation were the factors most strongly associated with prevalence of chronic bronchitis. There were three major new findings: (a) long term (>5 years) occupational exposure to cold and draught was associated with a significantly increased prevalence of chronic bronchitis; compared with others, and adjusted for confounders, the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was 1.4 (1.1 to 1.7), p=0.004; (b) a significant J shaped association existed between alcohol use and bronchitis, p<0.001, with the lowest prevalence found among moderate users; (c) a significant gene by environment association existed between smoking and the NS-phenotype in the MNS blood group; only among smokers was the NS-phenotype associated with a significantly decreased risk of chronic bronchitis, OR 0.67 (0.47-0.97), p=0.02. Other well known associations between dust, fumes, and even exposure to solvents and bronchitis were confirmed. CONCLUSION: The results emphasise the multifactorial nature of chronic bronchitis, and show some hitherto unrecognised associations between cold and draught exposure, alcohol consumption, and the NS-phenotype and chronic bronchitis
