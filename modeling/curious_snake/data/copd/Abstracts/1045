The molecular diversity of protein D of nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae strains isolated from persistently infected patients with chronic bronchitis was studied by sequencing the hpd gene of four independently obtained isolates. The nucleotide (nt) sequences of the hpd genes of two strains were identical. The other two hpd sequences showed nt substitutions which were mostly synonymous. As a consequence the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences differed from the consensus sequence only by a few aa. No changes in the hpd genes were observed among the four variants of the four strains persisting in chronic bronchitis patients for 9, 11, 8 and 3 months, respectively, although variation in their major outer membrane proteins P2 and P5 occurred. We conclude that the hpd gene is conserved during chronic infections of nonencapsulated H. influenzae
