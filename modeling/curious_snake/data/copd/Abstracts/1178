The expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in untreated or in steroid-dependent asthmatic patients is poorly understood. We therefore studied GR mRNA and protein levels in bronchial biopsies obtained from seven untreated asthmatic patients, seven control volunteers, and seven patients with chronic bronchitis. We also studied in bronchial epithelial cells obtained by brushing from 13 untreated asthmatics, 18 steroid-dependent asthmatics, 11 control volunteers, and 12 patients with chronic bronchitis, GR and heat shock protein 90 kD (hsp90) mRNA as well as the immunoreactivity of GR, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GR mRNA and protein level was similar in all subject groups in both biopsies and bronchial epithelial cells. Hsp90 mRNA level was also similar in all subject groups. ICAM-1 expression was significantly increased in bronchial epithelial cells from untreated asthmatics, but ICAM-1 was not expressed in those from steroid-dependent asthmatic patients. GM-CSF expression was significantly increased in bronchial epithelial cells from untreated and steroid-dependent asthmatic patients. GR expression within the airways is unaltered by oral long-term steroid treatment in asthma, but the expression of some but not all specific markers for asthma is modified by oral steroid
