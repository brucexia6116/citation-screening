We report on a case of the chronic form of paracoccidioidomycosis with swelling and ulcerations of the mouth in a German legionnaire who also suffered from a chronic bronchitis. The patient had worked for many years in Brazil, an area endemic for the disease. Infection due to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis was diagnosed in Germany, more than 10 years after the patient's return. Diagnosis was established by the presence of yeast cells with multipolar budding in the tissue of the oral lesion. Furthermore, the fungus was grown in a liquid Leishmania culture medium. Identification of the fungus was based on morphology and genetic sequencing. Furthermore, IgG antibodies against a 43-kDa antigen of P. brasiliensis were detected in a western blot. After itraconazole therapy (400 mg day(-1)) for 4 weeks, the lesions had disappeared almost completely, but the therapy was continued for further 5 months to avoid relapse of the infection
