BACKGROUND: Individuals with asthma are sensitive to inhaled sulfur dioxide (SO2); decrements in pulmonary function occur after exposure to low concentrations even for a short duration of time. There is a great amount of interindividual variation in response to SO2. OBJECTIVE: It was our objective to determine whether one of the following polymorphism locations linked with asthma is associated with the bronchial hyperresponsiveness to SO2 observed in some asthmatic patients: the beta2-adrenergic receptor, interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor alpha subunit, Clara cell secretory protein (CC16), TNF-alpha gene promoter, and first intron of the lymphotoxin alpha (LT-alpha) gene. METHODS: Subjects were volunteers with physician-diagnosed asthma requiring regular asthma medication. Spirometry was performed before and after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5 ppm SO2. Subjects were classified as SO2 responders if forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) decreased > or = 12%. DNA obtained from buccal cell samples was analyzed for genetic polymorphisms. RESULTS: Of the 62 subjects (21 male and 41 female), 13 had a 12% or greater decrement in FEV1 after SO2 exposure (range + 19% to -49%). Response to SO2 was associated with the wild-type allele of the TNF-alpha promoter polymorphism (12 of 12 SO2 responders versus 28 of 46 nonresponders; P < .05) but with no other polymorphisms. Medication category and atopic status showed no association with SO2 sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The wild-type allele of the TNF-alpha promoter polymorphism may be associated with mechanisms of asthmatic sensitivity to inhaled SO2
