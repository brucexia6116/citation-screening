Proteinase-3 (PR3) is a polymorphonuclear leukocyte serine proteinase that is a potent inducer of emphysema in experimental models. PR3 is also the target antigen associated with Wegener's granulomatosis. By analysis of a panel of somatic cell hybrids, the gene encoding PR3 was localized previously to chromosome 19; we have used fluorescence in situ hybridization to sublocalize this gene to 19p13.3
