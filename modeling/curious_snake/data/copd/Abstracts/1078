The lung is the major site expressing plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) mRNA in humans and mice, suggesting that this protein might have an important role in maintaining normal function of this organ. In the lung of human collagenase transgenic mice, an emphysematous animal model, PLTP mRNA was 3-fold higher than in control mice. However, the mRNA in other tissues was not changed. To further assess the expression and function of PLTP, we measured PLTP mRNA level in lung tissue of two emphysematous patients and found that the mRNA was 4-fold higher than in control subjects. In situ hybridization on mouse lung suggested positive staining in alveolar type II epithelial cells. In addition, immortalized rat alveolar pre-type II epithelial cells and freshly isolated mature rat alveolar type II epithelial cells both highly expressed PLTP mRNA, and the former cells actively secreted PLTP activity into the medium. To examine the possible mechanisms leading to high levels of PLTP expression in vivo, we exposed the pre-type II cells to hypoxia and demonstrated induction of PLTP mRNA and a coordinate increase in secreted PLTP activity. Thus, the PLTP gene is highly expressed in alveolar type II epithelial cells and is induced during hypoxia and in emphysema. These observations suggest that a hypoxic stimulus occurring in emphysema may be a novel mechanism that contributes to enhanced expression of PLTP
