Previous research has shown that forced expiratory volume (FEV) is a useful predictor of remaining life in older adults. The present analyses are an attempt to replicate results from a study of Swedish twins which demonstrated substantial heritability of FEV with a sample of middle-aged Russian adult twins. Data were collected from 116 pairs of Russian twins (monozygote = 71, dizygotic = 45, mean age = 40.9 years). Phenotypic correlations between FEV, age, gender, height, and cigarette consumption (in pack years) were all significant, ranging from -.72 to .31. After the effects of age, gender, height, and smoking were partialled out of FEV, quantitative genetic analyses were conducted. Shared environmental effects were significant, accounting for 47% of the variance in FEV. Genetic effects, which accounted for about 28% of the variance, could be dropped from the model without a significant decrease in the fit. These results are discussed in relation to previous research conducted in other countries
