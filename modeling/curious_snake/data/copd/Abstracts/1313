Lung functions were studied in contemporary healthy boy athletes of Ladakhi, Delhi, Vanvasi and Siddi origin. As lung function are related to ethnic and environmental factors, the aim of the study was to compare the lung function in boys belonging to these four groups. Vital Capacity (VC), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in 1st second (FEV1), Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV) and Inspiratory Capacity (IC) were recorded using conventional closed circuit spirometry. Maximum Voluntary Ventilation (MVV) was estimated collecting expired air during deep and rapid breathing in a 100 litres meterological balloon for a period of 15 seconds and measuring its volume. It was found that Ladakhi boys were having significantly higher VC, FVC and FEV1 values than their counterparts. However, there was no significant difference in MVV amongst Ladakhi, Delhi, Vanvasi and Siddi boys. Our results suggest that size of the lung is governed by genetic, environmental and nutritional factors and confirm that physical training during growth may help in developing a greater endurance in respiratory muscles
