The cystic fibrosis membrane conductance regulator can be activated through beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2AR) stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that coding sequence polymorphisms in the beta2AR gene contribute to the disease state in patients with cystic fibrosis. The Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu, and Thr164Ile beta2AR polymorphisms were studied by specific polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 126 cystic fibrosis patients. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in cystic fibrosis patients carrying the Gly16 allele in either homozygous or heterozygous form (Gly16Gly + Arg16Gly) compared to patients homozygous for the Arg16 allele (60.3 +/- 3.5% versus 75.7 +/- 4.9% predicted). Similarly, forced vital capacity and flows at lower lung volumes were significantly (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) lower in cystic fibrosis patients carrying the Gly16 allele. In addition, the Gly16 allele was associated with a greater 5 year decline in pulmonary function (P < 0.01). Bronchodilator responses to albuterol were not significantly different between the groups. The Thr164Ile variant was found in four patients; these patients had markedly reduced pulmonary function. Isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP formation was significantly blunted in cystic fibrosis patients carrying either the Gly16 allele or Thr164Ile genotype compared to cystic fibrosis patients homozygous for the respective Arg16 alleles. These data provide the first evidence suggesting that polymorphisms of the beta2AR gene contribute to clinical severity and disease progression in cystic fibrosis
