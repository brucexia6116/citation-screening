A severe deficiency of the serum protein alpha-1-antitrypsin can be expected to occur in 1 in 750 European New Zealanders. It can usually be identified by a faint or absent alpha-1 band on serum protein electrophoresis. Forty-seven cases are presented. 31 phenotype ZZ and 16 phenotype SZ. Eighteen have developed emphysema usually by age 40 years, two show childhood liver disease. One adult died of liver disease and three of the emphysema patients had liver abnormalities at post mortem. The remainder, mainly aged less than 30 years, are as yet asymptomatic. Individuals at risk should be protected from respiratory irritants (cigarettes, dusty environments and chest infections) and liver toxins (e.g., alcohol). The partial deficiency state (MZ) which occurs in 4 percent of the population also predisposes to respiratory and perhaps liver disease
