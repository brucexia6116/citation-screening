The author uses previously unpublished plant worker mortality data, which underlie the 1990 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Report on Dioxin, to identify additional tissue/organ/system sites at which dioxin exposure causes or is associated with a reduction in mortality. These new observations in men include reductions in urinary organ cancers, including bladder cancers; multiple myeloma; respiratory diseases, including emphysema and pneumoconioses and other respiratory diseases; total disease other than cancer; and total disease. Explanations are provided for why some of these reductions, observed in the NIOSH internal plant comparisons, were not noted in Bertazzi and colleagues' R-region men, how men and women differ in their responses to dioxin exposure in common tissues, and how a dioxin complex might interact with the body's DNA to promote-block cancers in one tissue and to promote cancers in that tissue or another.
