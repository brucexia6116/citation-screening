The phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-differentiated myelomonocytic cell line, THP-1, and human alveolar macrophages contain the cysteine proteinase cathepsin L. This enzyme is synthesized as a 43-kD proenzyme and processed to the active 25-kD form. Differentiation of THP-1 cells in the presence of human serum resulted in an increase in the size of the vacuolar compartment and the accumulation of more 25-kD cathepsin L antigen, as compared with THP-1 cells differentiated in the presence of fetal calf serum. Cells cultured in both types of sera have equivalent levels of cathepsin L mRNA. Metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated equivalent rates of synthesis, processing to the active form, and persistence in both culture conditions. An extracellular source of enzyme was documented by immunoblotting human serum which demonstrated 25-kD cathepsin L antigen; furthermore, we demonstrated that both THP-1 cells, differentiated in human serum, and human alveolar macrophages take up the 43-kD proenzyme and process it to the 25-kD form. Thus, human serum contains a factor(s) that induces both a marked increase in the size of the vacuolar compartment in differentiated THP-1 cells and a novel pathway that is responsible for the uptake and processing of extracellular cathepsin L. The activity of this inducible pathway is a major determinant of levels of intracellular cathepsin L. Cathepsin L is a potent elastase and the regulation of its uptake and processing may play a role in the pathogenesis of disease processes characterized by the destruction of elastin, such as pulmonary emphysema
