There are genetic and exogenous factors responsible for alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) deficiency which may lead to cirrhosis of the liver and emphysema. The present study was initiated on a biochemical level in order to determine whether acetaldehyde, the major product of ethanol metabolism, is capable of influencing the physiological effect of alpha 1-AT upon elastase, an enzyme which is capable of inducing emphysema. The effects of acetaldehyde and ethanol upon elastase and alpha 1-AT were tested. Acetaldehyde at 0.3-M and 1.2-M concentrations inhibited the anti-elastase activity of alpha 1-AT. Acetaldehyde at 0.03-M and 0.07-M concentrations did not affect elastase activity and had a slight effect at 0.12-M levels. Equivalent amounts of ethanol were without influence upon elastase activity or alpha 1-AT function. These data provide biochemical support for the possibility that heterozygous males with lower than normal alpha 1-AT levels may be at much higher risk to develop liver disease, emphysema, and alpha 1-AT deficiency as a consequence of chronic exposure to ethanol and concomitant circulating acetaldehyde levels
