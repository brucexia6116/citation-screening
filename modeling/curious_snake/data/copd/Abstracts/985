alpha1-Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a common inherited cause of emphysema and cirrhotic liver disease. Current laboratory diagnosis of Pi (proteinase inhibitor) status by protein analysis depends on the availability of blood samples and has a limited accuracy. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing can be performed from blood cells or from tissue samples, but it is a time-consuming procedure not suitable for screening purposes. We used a Light-Cycler assisted PCR approach to identify the PiZ mutation and to determine hetero- and homozygous carrier status from whole blood and from paraffin-embedded archival tissue specimens. The results were compared to those obtained by standard PCR amplification followed by SSCP and direct DNA sequencing. Light-Cycler assisted PCR identified heterozygous PiZ mutations in 16 samples, a homozygous PiZ status in three cases, and wild-type PiM in five control samples. In all cases the results were confirmed by SSCP and direct DNA sequencing. Light-Cycler assisted PCR has a high detection rate for the PiZ mutation. It can be performed from blood or from fixed archival tissues, requires only small amounts of DNA, and allows a rapid diagnosis on a high output level
