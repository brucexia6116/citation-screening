We examined elderly heterozygotes for alpha-antitrypsin deficiency (phenotype MZ) to determine which of several factors might be associated with the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Elderly heterozygotes who smoked had a very high incidence of COPD (70 per cent), whereas homozygotes (phenotype MM) who smoked had a significantly lower incidence of COPD (35 per cent). There was no difference in the incidence of COPD between subjects with MM and MZ phenotypes who did not smoke. To determine if leukocyte enzymes were related to the development of COPD in elderly heterozygotes, we measured the activities of monocytic acid cathepsin, neutrophil acid cathepsin, neutral cathepsin, and elastase. The activities of these enzymes were not associated with the development of COPD or with smoking history in the heterozygotes. In conclusion, cigarette smoking seemed to be a significant determinant of the development of COPD in heterozygotes for alpha-antitrypsin deficiency, but the leukocyte enzyme actitivty that we studied was unrelated
