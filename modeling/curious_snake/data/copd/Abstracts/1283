Alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha-1-AT) deficiency can lead to juvenile liver cirrhosis and lung emphysema in adulthood. The deficiency Z allele is caused by a base transition. Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) and hybrid isoelectric focusing (HIEF) were used to detect carriers of the Z mutation of the alpha-1-AT gene. The resulting data were compared. To verify carriers at the sequence level, a manual nonradioactive sequencing strategy was established. Among our sample of carriers of the Z mutation, two were not detected by HIEF that could be identified by TGGE. DNA of all TGGE identified individuals harboring the Z mutation of the alpha-1-AT gene were sequenced nonradioactively. All carriers harbored a G to A transition at position 11.940. This mutation is described to cause the altered protein
