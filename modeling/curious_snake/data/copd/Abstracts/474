Proteinase/antiproteinase imbalance is recognized to play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A relative increase in the activities of matrix metalloproteinases might be caused by mutations of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase2 (TIMP2). Recently, two polymorphisms of the TIMP2 gene, +853 G/A and -418 G/C (+551 and -720 from the translation initiation site), have been shown to be associated with the development of COPD in the Japanese population. In this study, a case-control association analysis for these polymorphisms was conducted in the Egyptian population using 106 COPD patients and 72 healthy controls. The genotype frequency of +853 G/A was significantly different between the patient and the control groups (P = 0.029), although no significant difference was detected in the allele frequency between the two groups. These results suggest that the +853 G/A polymorphism of the TIMP2 gene might be associated with COPD across ethnicities. In contrast, neither the distributions of genotype nor allele frequencies of -418 G/C were significantly different between the two groups, raising the possibility that a combination of different genetic factors contributes to the development of COPD in different ethnic groups
