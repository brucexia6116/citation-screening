The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral N-acetylcysteine in the prevention of re-hospitalisation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Using the PHARmacoMOrbidity linkage (PHARMO) system the authors included all patients aged > or = 55 yrs who had been dispensed medication, labelled for respiratory indications (anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system: R03), between 1986-1998 and who had also been hospitalised for COPD (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9: 491, 492, 496) in this time frame. These subjects were subsequently divided into two groups, those who had received N-acetylcysteine following discharge from their first admission between 1986-1998 and those who had not. All the patients were studied starting from their initial discharge, until their first readmission, death or end of data collection period. The maximum follow-up period was 1 yr. A total of 1,219 patients, who were hospitalised for COPD between 1986-1998, were included in this study. After adjustment for disease severity, it was observed that the use of N-acetylcysteine was significantly associated with a reduced risk of readmission. The readmission risk was significantly lower in patients with high average daily doses of N-acetylcysteine. In conclusion it was observed that N-acetylcysteine reduces the risk of rehospitalisation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by approximately 30% and that this risk reduction is dose-dependent
