Three generations of relatives of 58-year-old nonidentical twins with chronic bronchitis and fibrotic lung disease were evaluated. Sera of 23 family members, 14 with a history of excessive sinopulmonary infections, were examined for deficiencies of immunoglobulin classes, IgG subclasses, and specific antibody to tetanus toxoid and Hemophilus influenzae type b. Of 14 symptomatic family members, 12 had serum IgE concentrations less than 5 IU/ml. Four had values less than 1 IU/ml. Serum IgE was greater than 10 IU/ml in all nine asymptomatic individuals. Inheritance of low IgE appeared to be autosomal dominant, with variable penetrance. IgA was low normal (70-90 mg/dl) in three individuals. Two of these were IgE deficient. One symptomatic child had unmeasurable IgG2 (less than 10 mg/dl) and IgE (less than 0.5 IU/ml). This kindred demonstrates that IgE deficiency can be familial, and associated with sinopulmonary disease
