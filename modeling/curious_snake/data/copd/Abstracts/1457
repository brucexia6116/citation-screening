The clinical presentation, courses, and sweat chloride values of 72 CF patients with normal fat absorption are described. In general, these patients had milder clinical symptoms and a lower mean sweat chloride value than their counterparts with steatorrhoea. Pulmonary function tests, including FEV1, FVC, FEF25%-75%, PaO2, and RV/TLC%, were significantly better in patients with normal fat absorption compared with both male and female patients who had steatorrhoea. The maintenance of better pulmonary function, coupled with the low mortality, suggests that patients without steatorrhoea have a better prognosis. This difference remains unexplained, but may be contributed to by nutritional, genetic, or pancreatic factors
