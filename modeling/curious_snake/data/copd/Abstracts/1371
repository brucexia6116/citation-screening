Proteinase-3 (PR-3) is a neutral serine proteinase present in the azurophil granules of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It degrades a variety of extracellular matrix proteins including elastin in vitro and causes emphysema when administered by tracheal insufflation to hamsters. It is identical to the target autoantigen (c-ANCA) associated with Wegener's granulomatosis and to myeloblastin, a serine proteinase first identified in HL-60 leukemia cells. In this study, the gene encoding PR-3 was cloned and sequenced. The gene spans approximately 6.5 kilobase pairs and consists of five exons and four introns. The genomic organization of PR-3 is similar to that of the other serine proteinases expressed in hemopoietic cells. Each residue of the catalytic triad of PR-3 is located on a separate exon, and the positions of the residues within the exons are similar to those in human leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G. The phase and placement of the introns in the PR-3 gene are also similar to those in human leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G. The 400-base pair (bp) 5'-flanking sequence of the PR-3 gene contains a TATA box at position 379. There is no CAAT box promoter element. The 3'-untranslated region is 200 bp, extending from a TGA stop codon to the site of polyadenylation 10 bp after the canonical AATAAA signal. Amplification of PR-3 from a human/hamster hybrid cell line localizes the gene to human chromosome 19. Evidence from Northern analysis suggests that PR-3 expression is primarily confined to the promyelocytic/myelocytic stage of bone marrow development
