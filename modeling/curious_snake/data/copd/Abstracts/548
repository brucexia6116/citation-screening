BACKGROUND: The glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) gene is involved in detoxification of electrophilic substances of tobacco smoke. A polymorphism at nucleotide 315 of this gene alters its enzymatic activity. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the association between the variability in the GSTP1 gene and impairment in lung function in smokers with and without alpha(1)-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency and COPD.Population and method: The study population consisted of 99 patients with smoking-related COPD and 69 patients with AAT deficiency; 198 healthy volunteers provided the frequency of the different polymorphisms in the general population. GSTP1 genotyping was performed by a real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification assay. RESULTS: The frequency (0.28) of the 105Val polymorphism was identical in COPD patients and the general population. However, the frequency was significantly increased (0.44) in patients with AAT deficiency (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17 to 3.72 compared to control subjects; and OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.27 to 4.59 compared to COPD). FEV(1) percentage of predicted was significantly impaired in AAT-deficient carriers of 105Val. This effect was not observed in COPD patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the frequency of the GSTP1 105Val polymorphism is increased in patients with AAT deficiency. Globally, GSTP1 genotypes, age, and tobacco smoking explained 41% of total FEV(1) percentage of predicted variability in patients with AAT deficiency. The modulatory role of GSTP1 in lung disease has only been observed in smokers lacking AAT
