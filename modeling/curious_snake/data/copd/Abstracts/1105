The presence and distribution of neuropeptide-containing nerves within bronchial surgical specimens has been investigated in bronchitic (n = 12) and in nonbronchitic subjects (n = 7). Lung tissue, obtained from patients undergoing thoracotomy for limited lung lesions, was processed immediately and analyzed for nerves using the streptavidin-biotin complex peroxidase method with antisera to the neural marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) and the neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P (SP), calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the density of PGP 9.5-, SP-, or CGRP-positive nerves in both the locations assessed (smooth muscle layer and glands). The density of VIP-positive nerves was significantly higher in the glands of bronchitic than in nonbronchitic subjects. A negative relationship was found between the presence of airway inflammation, as indexed by mononuclear cell tissue infiltration, and the density of PGP 9.5-positive nerves in both smooth muscle and glands. Likewise, a relationship was found between the smoking history (packs/yr and age of onset of smoking) and the density of VIP-positive nerves in glands. These findings support a role for VIP in the hallmark of chronic bronchitis, i.e., sputum production
