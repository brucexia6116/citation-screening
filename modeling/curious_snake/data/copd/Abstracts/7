This is the first report to describe a role for Lung Kruppel-like Factor (LKLF or KLF2) in inflammatory airways diseases. In the present study, we identify that LKLF is constitutively expressed in the small airways of normal lungs; however, its expression disappears in severe airway diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. LKLF from primary airway epithelial cells inhibits NF-kappaB-driven transcription induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 7-fold, but is down-regulated in the presence of TNF-alpha and activated human neutrophils. As a constitutively expressed protein, LKLF inhibits release of a key pro-inflammatory chemokine, IL-8, from airway epithelia. Its expression by lung epithelial cells is enhanced in the presence of TNF blockade. Thus, cytokine-mediated inhibition of LKLF by neutrophils may contribute to ongoing recruitment by promoting IL-8 release from airway epithelia. We conclude that, in neutrophil-dominated airway environments, such as that seen in CF, reduced LKLF activity releases a brake on pro-inflammatory cytokine production and thereby may contribute to the persistent inflammatory responses seen in CF airway disease
