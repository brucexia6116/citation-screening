The pathogenesis of gastroduodenal ulcer associated with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease is complicated, as is the pathogenesis of these two disease entities separately. It is evident that a multifactorial dependence is involved which has not yet been resolved completely. Hence, there is no "magna cause morbi" but rather a multiform and dynamically variable chain of causes, consequences and conditions, some of which may be of genetic dependence. In the possible complex of causes leading to the genesis of gastroduodenal ulcer associated with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, the author investigated the effect of isolated hypercapnia on the acidity of gastric juice and mucous membrane in 18 healthy normacid subjects. The results of this study that in healthy subjects isolated hypercapnia leads to a statistically significant increase in acidity of gastric juice and mucous membrane
