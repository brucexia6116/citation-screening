Phosphodiesterase (PDE) constitutes a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of cAMP and cGMP into their corresponding monophosphates and play an important role in diverse physiological functions. The present study provides a process for identifying PDE4 subtypes selective inhibitors using a reporter gene assay. Stable recombinant HEK-293 cell lines expressing high levels of PDE4A4B, PDE4B2A, and PDE4D3 subtypes individually were generated. Transient transfection of pCRE-Luc plasmid, harboring luciferase reporter gene under the control of cAMP response element (CRE)-binding sequence, into these stable recombinant cell lines followed by treatment with PDE4 inhibitor, resulted in a dose dependent increase in luciferase activity. This methods provide a novel, simple and sensitive assay for high throughput screening of PDE4 subtype selective inhibitors for treatment of asthma and COPD
