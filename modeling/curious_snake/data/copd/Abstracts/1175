In several studies the HLA system has been implicated in the development of asthma, but the importance of the associations between HLA genes and asthma remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the HLA class I and II phenotypic frequencies in a population of asthmatics, and to analyse the relationship between these phenotypes and any type of asthma. We typed HLA class I and II antigens in a series of 189 asthmatic individuals (102 atopic and 87 non-atopic), and in a control population of 150 unrelated healthy Caucasoid donors. When the HLA phenotypic frequencies were compared, no statistical differences were found. Therefore, no definitive HLA association could be established with atopic or non-atopic asthma in the studied population. Abbreviations AA, atopic asthma; FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 1 s; NAA, non-atopic asthma; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SSOP, sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes; SPT, skin prick test
