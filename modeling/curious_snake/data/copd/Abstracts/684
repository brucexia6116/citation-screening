Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic inflammation in the airways, parenchyma and vessels, which can cause a structural remodeling with increased fibrosis that narrows and fixes the airway lumen. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), a multifunctional growth factor, was reported to be increased in the airways of COPD patients. In this study, we hypothesized that polymorphisms in the TGF-beta1 gene would be associated with an accelerated rate of decline of forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)). Three polymorphisms, -509 (C-->T), +869 (T-->C) and +915 (G-->C), located in TGF-beta1 gene were genotyped. We determined the prevalence of these polymorphisms in 590 continuing smokers who had the fastest (n=283) and slowest (n=307) rate of decline of lung function from the NHLBI Lung Health Study. There was no association between these TGF-beta1 polymorphisms and the rate of decline of FEV(1), but in a post-hoc analysis the genotype distribution at +869 was significantly different between high and low responders to methacholine (P=0.04). These data suggest that the T-C polymorphism at position +869 in the TGF-beta1 gene contributes to airway hyperresponsiveness, but not to rapid decline of lung function
