Haemophilus influenzae is an important cause of otitis media in children and lower respiratory infection in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients with COPD experience periodic exacerbations that are associated with acquisition of new bacterial strains. However, not every strain acquisition is associated with exacerbation. To test the hypothesis that genetic differences among strains account for differences in pathogenic potential, a microarray consisting of 4,992 random 1.5- to 3-kb genomic fragments of an exacerbation strain was constructed. Competitive hybridization was performed using six strains associated with exacerbation as well as five strains associated with asymptomatic colonization. Seven sequences that were absent in all five colonization strains and present in at least two exacerbation strains were identified. One such sequence was a previously unreported gene with high homology to the meningococcal immunoglobulin A (IgA) protease gene, which is distinct from the previously described H. influenzae IgA protease. To assess the distribution of the seven sequences among well-characterized strains of H. influenzae, 59 exacerbation strains and 73 asymptomatic colonization strains were screened by PCR for the presence of these sequences. The presence or absence of any single sequence was not significantly associated with exacerbations of COPD. However, logistic regression and subgroup analysis identified combinations of the presence and absence of genes that are associated with exacerbations. These results indicate that patterns of genes are associated with the ability of strains of H. influenzae to cause exacerbations of COPD, supporting the concept that differences in pathogenic potential are based in part on genomic differences among infecting strains, not merely host factors
