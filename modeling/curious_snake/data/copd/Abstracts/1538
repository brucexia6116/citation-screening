In most regards, aging of the human lungs mimics the development of emphysema. Various lines of evidence suggest that oxidants and proteases play an important role in the pathogenesis of emphysema. The disease seems to arise through a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. This paper explores the possibility that normal aging of the lungs, as it has been defined by various cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, is part of a pathological continuum ending with frank emphysema. It is not clear if these are "normal" aging effects or the result of the accumulation of disease
