We performed MBL2 genotyping in 47 CF patients-cared of at the regional CF Centre of Trieste-trying to establish a correlation within allelic variants of MBL2 and modification of patients' clinical outcome. FEV1 values were significantly lowered and a significantly earlier age at onset of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation was found in CF patients with at least one MBL2 variant
