Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) play an important role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis. The tetraspanin CD63 is a membrane marker of azurophilic granules and is actively involved in the process of PMN endocytosis and azurophilic granule exocytosis. In this study, we investigated genetic polymorphisms of the CD63 gene, quantified CD63 expression and PMN myeloperoxidase (MPO) release in healthy individuals and COPD patients. We evaluated the potential correlations between genetic polymorphisms and gene expression and MPO release. COPD patients had significantly lower CD63 expression and released less MPO upon chemokine stimulation compared with the healthy individuals. Eleven putative polymorphisms in the CD63 gene were investigated but only three were polymorphic in our study subjects. None of the polymorphisms was associated with CD63 expression in either the healthy subjects or the COPD patients. However, the 8041C/G polymorphism, which is located 3' to the CD63 gene, was associated with MPO release in the healthy subjects. The CC genotype was associated with greater MPO release than the GG genotype (P=0.007). These results suggest that COPD patients have different patterns of CD63 expression and PMN mediator release than healthy individuals. It is likely that genetic variants have limited effect on CD63 expression and MPO release in the context of COPD but their role in other diseases has yet to be determined
