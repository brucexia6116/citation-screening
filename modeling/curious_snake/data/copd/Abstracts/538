Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) act as neurotransmitters in numerous biological responses. We previously reported that the replacement of Lys by Arg, and Met by Leu in VIP (IK312532; [Arg15, 20, 21, Leu17]-VIP) resulted in a significant improvement in metabolic stability and biological activity. In the present study, we investigated the effect of VIP and its related peptides including long-acting VIP derivative (IK312532) and PACAP27 on the cytotoxicity of cigarette smoke extract (CSE), a causative factor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in rat alveolar L2 cells. RT-PCR displayed the dominant expression of mRNA for the VIP-specific VPAC2 receptor in L2 cells, and VIP and the related peptides showed the specific binding activity and potent stimulation of adenylate cyclase. CSE at a concentration of 0.1% or higher induced significant apoptotic death of L2 cells. Interestingly, the addition of neuropeptides at a concentration of 10(-11) M or higher in L2 cells with CSE (0.25%) resulted in significant attenuation of cell death with the deactivation of CSE-evoked caspase-3 activity. IK312532 was much stable against the enzymatic digestion compared to VIP, and the protective effect of IK312532 was 1.6-fold higher than that of VIP. Taken together with our previous report showing that IK312532 has long-acting relaxant activity in the lung, IK312532 may be a potential candidate for drug treatment of asthma and COPD
