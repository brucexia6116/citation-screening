Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitors isolated from plasmas of horse, ox, pig, rabbit and man were used for determination of some kinetic parameters of interaction with three horse leucocyte proteinases and bovine pancreatic trypsin and chymotrypsin. Effective molar ratio of enzyme-to-inhibitor, inactivation rate constant and inhibition constant were measured. In horse, ox, pig and rabbit two principal electrophoretic forms of alpha 1-PI could be distinguished. Both forms effectively inhibited trypsin but usually only one form reacted promptly and stoichiometrically with chymotrypsin and leucocyte elastases. It appears that genetic variability and functional heterogeneity of multiple forms of alpha 1-PI as well as lack of other tissue inhibitors of proteinases may be responsible for lung emphysema occurring in man and horse
