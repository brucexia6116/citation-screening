BACKGROUND: Alpha-1-antitrypsin is the body's major inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase, a powerful proteolytic enzyme capable of degrading the common tissue components. There are over 70 genetic variants of alpha-1-antitrypsin, with the Z allele being of greatest clinical relevance. Individuals homozygous for this allele (approximately one in 2500 in Caucasians) have low serum alpha-1-antitrypsin levels (10-20% of normal) and are predisposed to emphysema, especially if they smoke. Much rarer are mutations which result in the complete or almost complete absence of alpha-1-antitrypsin in the serum. AIM: To determine the cause of complete absence of alpha-1-antitrypsin in a patient who at age 27 years had both emphysema and idiopathic cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Molecular biology techniques were used to sequence the alpha-1-antitrypsin gene. Allele specific amplification was used to show the presence of the mutations in other family members. RESULTS: Investigation showed that the proband was homozygous for the Pi Null Bellingham variant of alpha-1-antitrypsin due to the mutation Lys 217 (AAG) to Stop (TAG). His grandmother was heterozygous for Pi Null Bellingham and the additional rare variant P Lowell, Asp 256 (GAT) to Val (GTT), a variant that also results in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. CONCLUSION: Patients with complete absence of alpha-1-antitrypsin develop premature emphysema not having smoked or after only minimal exposure, and much earlier than the more common Pi Z individuals who have the usual form of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
