alpha(1)-Antitrypsin is the most abundant protease inhibitor in plasma and is the archetype of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily. Genetic variants of human alpha(1)-antitrypsin are associated with early-onset emphysema and liver cirrhosis. However, the detailed molecular mechanism for the pathogenicity of most variant alpha(1)-antitrypsin molecules is not known. Here we examined the structural basis of a dozen deficient alpha(1)-antitrypsin variants. Unlike most alpha(1)-antitrypsin variants, which were unstable, D256V and L41P variants exhibited extremely retarded protein folding as compared with the wild-type molecule. Once folded, however, the stability and inhibitory activity of these variant proteins were comparable to those of the wild-type molecule. Retarded protein folding may promote protein aggregation by allowing the accumulation of aggregation-prone folding intermediates. Repeated observations of retarded protein folding indicate that it is an important mechanism causing alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency by variant molecules, which have to fold into the metastable native form to be functional
