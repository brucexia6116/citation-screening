The aim of this study was to relate serum immunoglobulin G2 subclass levels in a large paediatric population with cystic fibrosis, to clinical status and antibody levels to Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae and to observe any changes over a 2-year period. IgG subclasses were measured in 131 patients. Results were compared with levels from age-related normal population data. The following clinical data were collected at baseline and 2 years later; genotype: height, weight, and BMI z-scores: FEV1 (as percent predicted): Shwachman-Kulczcyki and Northern chest X-ray scores: Pseudomonas aeruginosa status. Antibody levels to H. influenzae type b and S. pneumoniae measured at baseline were related to IgG2 level. There was a reduction in the prevalence of low levels of IgG2 from 29% to 10% over the 2-year period. Low levels of IgG2 were not associated with any decline in clinical well-being. Low levels of IgG2 alone were associated with low antibody levels to S. pneumoniae. Low levels of IgG2 and low levels of antibody to H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were not associated with any decline in clinical well-being. Children with high levels of IgG2 had worse lung function, worse Shwachman-Kulczcyki and Northern chest X-ray scores and higher levels of P. aeruginosa infection. Children with low IgG2 levels were not worse clinically compared to those with normal or high IgG2 levels. High IgG2 levels were associated with a worse clinical status. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc
