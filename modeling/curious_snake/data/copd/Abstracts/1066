Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a common genetic defect associated with the development of severe and rapidly progressive lung disease. This study was undertaken to determine whether respiratory physicians manage patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency differently from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. In addition we obtained physicians' views on who should be tested for AAT deficiency. A questionnaire was administered to 88 respiratory physicians based throughout the U.K. (44 in teaching hospitals). The main outcome measures were pulmonary function tests, radiological assessment, frequency of repeat testing, follow-up and screening protocol for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Subjects with homozygous (PiZ) AAT deficiency were more likely to: 1. have baseline and full pulmonary function testing including dynamic flow rates, static lung volumes, and gas transfer; 2. have more comprehensive assessment with high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) thorax and repeated radiological assessment (with annual chest radiography); 3. be followed-up routinely; and 4. have family members tested for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Testing remains limited for AAT deficiency and is mainly restricted to young patients with COPD. COPD assessment and management is influenced by the presence of AAT deficiency, which may reflect the poorer prognosis of such patients due to more rapid decline. Assessment and monitoring could be simplified to forced expired manoeuvres, although limited HRCT thorax and tests of gas transfer may prove more sensitive to progression of emphysema. Testing for AAT deficiency in the U.K. remains restricted, which will influence the detection rate for AAT deficiency. A wider policy of testing was advocated by the WHO will detect more patients and also influence our understanding of the natural history of the condition
