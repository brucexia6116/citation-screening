OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression levels of heat shock proteins (HSP) mRNA in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with asthma and chronic bronchitis to elucidate the role of HSP in the pathogenesis of asthma and chronic bronchitis. METHOD: Using reverse transcription-DNA polymerase chain reaction, the expression levels of HSP70, HSP90alpha and HSP90beta genes in PBMC in normal state and after heat shock were investigated. RESULTS: No HSP70 gene but HSP90alpha and HSP90beta expressions were found in non-heat-shocked PBMC of normal controls; HSP90alpha and HSP90beta genes may be expressed in PBMC of all patients, independently of acute episodes. Expression of HSP70 was found in PBMC of asthmatic patients in acute episodes and three symptom-free patients with Aas 3, step 2. Among patients with chronic bronchitis, no HSP70 gene expression was found in PBMC of patients in convalescent period but in PBMC of patients in acute episode. HSP90alpha and HSP90beta genes were expressed in PBMC of both patient groups. After heat shock, expressions of the three genes increased significantly in PBMC of both normal controls and patients. CONCLUSION: Expression of HSP70 gene in PBMC of asthmatic and chronic bronchitis patients was different, indicating that HSP, especially HSP70, might be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma
