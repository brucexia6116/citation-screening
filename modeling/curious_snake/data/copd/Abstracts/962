Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha is a cytokine endowed with potent inflammatory properties that may contribute to airway inflammation in asthma. It has previously been shown that the single base pair polymorphism-308 (G to A substitution) in the promoter of TNFalpha gene results in enhanced cytokine secretion. Whether this polymorphism is associated with the presence of phenotypic expression of asthma is questioned. In this study the relative frequency of TNF1 and TNF2 alleles in a population of adult healthy subjects (n=98) and adult Caucasian asthmatics (n=95) was compared taking into account their disease severity, atopic status and their smoking habit. For the whole group of asthma the genotype frequency for 1/1, 1/2, 2/2 were 67%, 33% and 0%, respectively, and not significantly different from those found in the control group that reached 70%, 28% and 2% respectively (p>0.05). The allele frequencies in asthma were 86% and 14% for TNF1 and TNF2 respectively while the corresponding figures were 85% and 15% in the control group (p>0.05). Furthermore, subdividing asthmatics into severe forced expiratory volume in one second <60% pred), atopic or smoking patients did not show any significant association with this TNFalpha polymorphism. To conclude the polymorphism -308 in the promoter of the TNFalpha gene does not confer a susceptibility to develop asthma nor to grade its severity
