1. Genetic variation at the glutathione S-transferase M1 locus (GSTM1) has been associated with a number of apparently unrelated cancers, including lung cancer. Emphysema is a common lung disease often found concomitant with lung cancer. Both emphysema and lung cancer may result from chemical and oxidative damage caused by reactive species present in cigarette smoke or released from neutrophils recruited following cigarette smoke induced injury. GSTM1 may protect against such damage through detoxification of cigarette smoke components. Polymorphism of this gene may thus influence susceptibility not just to lung cancer, but to other forms of lung disease. 2. Resection specimens from a group of 168 lung cancer patients were assessed for the presence of macroscopic centriacinar and panacinar emphysema. DNA was extracted from archival material and genotyped for the GSTM1 polymorphism using the polymerase chain reaction. A control group of 384 anonymous blood donations was used to determine the frequency of the GSTM1 gene deletion in a random control population. Reverse transcription on lung tissue was performed to investigate mRNA expression of GSTM1 and GSTM4. 3. In 57 lung cancer cases with no emphysema there was no association with homozygous deletion of the GSTM1 gene (51% null in cancer and 53% null in control groups). However in 111 patients with emphysema and lung cancer there was an increase in the frequency of deletion (65%, P = 0.032) giving an odds ratio of 1.36(0.32-2.40). In 43 cases there was evidence of both centriacinar and panacinar emphysema. The frequency of GSTM1 deletion was 70% (Odds ratio 2.11, 0.97-3.25). Both GSTM1 and GSTM4 mRNAs were expressed in lung tissue. 4 These findings suggest that GSTM1 has a general but rather small protective effect against toxicological injury in the lung which is not specific to cancer. This is of relevance in considering the health effects of exposure to a wide range of reactive chemicals in the environment
