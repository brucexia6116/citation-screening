BACKGROUND: Although variation in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus is associated with various diseases, there have been a limited number of studies that have examined the possible role of HLA in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Only HLA-B7 has been shown to be correlated with low forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) in Caucasians; however, this finding has not been replicated. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of the HLA-B7 allele to COPD and to rate of decline of lung function. METHODS: We determined the prevalence of HLA-B7 in a group of COPD patients and a non-obstructed control group of smokers by using a polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping assay. We also determined the prevalence of HLA-B7 in smokers selected from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, Lung Health Study for having the fastest and slowest decline of lung function. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in the frequency of HLA-B7 between the COPD and non-obstructed groups. There was also no significant association of HLA-B7 with rate of decline of lung function. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that HLA-B7 does not contribute to COPD or rate of decline of FEV1 in smokers
