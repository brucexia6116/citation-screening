A group of 163 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, from the pulmonary service of a large urban hospital, were evaluated for their protease inhibitor (Pi) type by starch gel and crossed immunoelectrophoresis, for serum concentrations of alpha1-antitrypsin and alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and for pulmonary function. Of the patients with emphysema, 17.8% were of Pi type Z; 50% of these were less than 45 years of age, compared to 13% of those of Pi type M. Of all patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 4.9% were of Pi type Z; 4.9% of patients were of Pi type MZ (heterozygotes) compared with 1.9% of the control population. There was an increased incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in persons of Pi type MZ, but no increase in persons of Pi type MS. Concentrations of both alpha1-antitrypsin and alpha1-antichymotrypsin were increased and were correlated. No patient had a deficiency of alpha1-antichymotrypsin
