The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of Burkholderia cepacia on cardiovascular status and mortality in cystic fibrosis. Seven patients infected with B. cepacia were matched with 31 patients not infected with this organism for gender, age, height, weight, genotype, and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second, partial arterial oxygen pressure, and pancreatic sufficiency status. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure, as assessed by transthoracic echocardiography, was significantly higher in patients infected with B. cepacia (61.3 +/- 17.2 mm Hg) than in controls (37.3 +/- 13.9 mm Hg; P = 0.02), and the mean acceleration time was significantly lower (77 +/- 33 ms versus 108 +/- 25 ms; P = 0.02). The 6-month mortality was significantly higher in patients infected with B. cepacia (57% versus 16%; P = 0.02). Six of the seven patients infected with B. cepacia harbored the same ribotype (genomovar II, B. multivorans). Pulmonary hypertension was significantly more frequent in patients infected by B. cepacia and could contribute to the increased mortality rate
