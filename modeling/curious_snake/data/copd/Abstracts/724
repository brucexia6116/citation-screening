BACKGROUND: Beta2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR) polymorphisms have been associated with a variety of asthma-related phenotypes, but association results have been inconsistent across different studies. OBJECTIVE: We sought to apply family-based association methods to individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes of SNPs in B2AR to define the relationship of these genetic variants to asthma-related phenotypes. METHODS: DNA samples were obtained from 707 Childhood Asthma Management Program participants, representing 650 sibships, as well as their parents. Genotyping was performed at 8 B2AR SNPs. Qualitative asthma-related phenotypes were analyzed with single SNPs and haplotypes by using TRANSMIT; quantitative asthma-related phenotypes were analyzed with the Family-Based Association Test. RESULTS: Several SNPs, including SNP -654 and SNP +46, demonstrated significant associations (P <.05) to postbronchodilator FEV1 as both a qualitative (<80% of predicted value) and quantitative phenotype. Quantitative phenotypic association analysis demonstrated significant evidence for association of SNP +523 with bronchodilator responsiveness expressed as a percentage of baseline FEV1 (P =.012) or a percentage of predicted FEV1 (P =.008). Similar evidence for association between the +523 SNP and qualitative bronchodilator responsiveness phenotypes was also found. Analysis of haplotypes supported an association of B2AR variants with spirometric values and bronchodilator responsiveness. CONCLUSION: B2AR variants are associated with spirometric values and bronchodilator responsiveness, but different regions of the gene provide evidence for association with these phenotypes
