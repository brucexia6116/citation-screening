The pathogenesis of sarcoidosis is not yet known. On the basis of seroepidemiological data, an association between Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and sarcoidosis has been suggested, but so far no study has addressed the direct detection of this agent in the affected tissues. The aim of the present study was to detect C. pneumoniae deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) within sarcoid tissue specimens by means of a two-step polymerase chain reaction. Lung biopsy specimens of 33 patients with histologically confirmed pulmonary sarcoidosis and 21 control lung biopsies or pathology specimens of patients with pulmonary carcinoma or emphysema were retrospectively analysed. A nested polymerase chain reaction was applied using two sets of primers designed to detect a fragment of the 16 strand ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene of C. pneumoniae. The results of the study failed to demonstrate the presence of C. pneumoniae in biopsy specimens of sarcoid tissue and in the control lung biopsies or pathology specimens. Our results, therefore, tend to rule out the possibility of a direct involvement of Chlamydia pneumoniae in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis
