STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequencies of three polymorphisms at amino acid positions 16, 27, and 164 of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)-AR) gene and their effects on COPD patients. DESIGN: Prospective, case-control study PATIENTS: Sixty-five patients with COPD and 41 healthy subjects were included. MEASUREMENTS: Polymorphisms of the beta(2)-AR coding block were delineated using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach. The allele-specific PCR technique was verified by direct dideoxy sequencing of PCR products. Pulmonary function tests were performed in all patients. RESULTS: The Arg16 beta(2)-AR polymorphism was less prevalent in COPD patients than in healthy populations (p = 0.01). A significant correlation (p < 0.018) between the Gln27 beta(2)-AR polymorphism and FEV(1) percent predicted value was found. Patients with the Gln27 polymorphism had a higher percentage of low FEV(1) percent predicted than did patients with the GlnGlu and GluGlu variants. CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphism of Gly16 may increase the patient's susceptibility to the development of COPD. The Gln27 beta(2)-AR polymorphism may be associated with the severity of COPD in a Chinese population
