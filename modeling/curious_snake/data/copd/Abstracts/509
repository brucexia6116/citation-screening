Cigarette smoke (CS)-induced emphysema is attributable to matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12) in mice, however, a relationship between CS and MMP-12 is absent in human emphysema. Here, we show that cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) induces MMP-12 gene expression in airway-like epithelia through a hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-dependent pathway involving NADPH oxidase, AP-1, and TNF-alpha. Cigarette smoke condensate-induced H(2)O(2) production and MMP-12 gene expression were inhibited by apocynin, a specific inhibitor of NADPH oxidases, while 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor of AP-1, attenuated CSC-induced MMP-12 gene expression. Messenger RNAs encoding phagocytic NADPH oxidase components and a homologue of p67phox, p51 (NOXA1), were detected, while mRNA of dual oxidase (Duox)1 was unchanged by CSC. Enbrel, an inhibitor of TNF-alpha function, reduced CSC-induced H(2)O(2) production and MMP-12 expression. These findings provide novel evidence of a direct relationship between CS exposure and MMP-12 in human airway epithelia and suggest several targets for modulation of this potentially pathogenic pathway
