Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been associated with a wide spectrum of pulmonary disease. We report three HIV-seropositive patients with rapidly worsening airway obstruction associated with bronchiectasis. All subjects (age range 33-39 yrs) were cigarette smokers. Two had previously used intravenous drugs. The CD4 lymphocyte count ranged 40-250 cells x mm(-3). All individuals had complained of increasing dyspnoea for 3-6 months. Within 1 yr, they all developed severe airway obstruction with a decrease in both forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) to less than 60% of predicted value, and a decrease in mean forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of the forced vital capacity (FEF25-75) to less than 35% of predicted value. Computed tomography of the chest disclosed bilateral dilated and thickened bronchi. No classical causes of genetic or acquired bronchiectasis were identified in our patients. Recurrent bacterial bronchitis occurred in the follow-up period of the three patients. In conclusion, unusually rapid airway obstruction associated with bronchiectasis should be added to the wide spectrum of respiratory complications of human immunodeficiency virus infection
