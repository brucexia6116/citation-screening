Chemotaxonomic and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses of an isolate from the bronchial secretions of a patient with chronic bronchitis demonstrated clearly that it belongs to the genus Nocardia. The 16S rRNA gene sequence data, as well as the biochemical characteristics of the isolate, indicated that it belongs to a new species that differs from previously described members of the genus Nocardia. The name Nocardia cyriacigeorgici sp. nov. is proposed for this isolate, and is represented by strain IMMIB D-1627T (= DSM 44484T)
