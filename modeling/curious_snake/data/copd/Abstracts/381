Data collected on adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and entered onto the CF database in the south and west regions of England were analysed for the year 2001. FEV1 was taken as a marker of lung disease severity. Data on 371 patients (158 female) mean age 24.7 years (range 16.0-48.9) were assessed. FEV1 was reduced in CF patients infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) (mean 62.6% predicted) compared with those without (mean FEV1 77.8%, P < 0.00001). The reduction was noted irrespective of age group. FEV1 progressively reduced with the increasing need for high-intensity treatment (P < 0.00001) and with the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (P = 0.03). FEV1 correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r = + 0.42, P < 0.0001). Genetic profile and poverty and deprivation score did not affect the value of FEV1. Chronic infection with Pa mainly in young adults, treatment intensity, diabetes mellitus and reduced body mass index are associated with reduced FEV1 in adult patients with cystic fibrosis in the south and west regions of England. In this relatively affluent area, scores of poverty and deprivation were not associated with the decline in lung function tests
