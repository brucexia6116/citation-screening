Adenovirus E1A DNA and proteins are frequently detected in lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Because adenovirus E1A can regulate host gene expression by interacting with cellular transcription factors, we postulate that E1A enhances synthesis of inflammatory mediators. To examine this possibility, we measured the expression of inflammatory cytokines in E1A-producing A549 human pulmonary epithelial cells and control cells. Interleukin (IL)-8 mRNA was markedly induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in E1A-producing cells but not in controls. IL-8 protein levels were elevated in parallel. In both cell types, monocyte chemotactic and activating factor mRNA induced by LPS was low, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 mRNA was not affected. IL-1 beta, IL-6, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mRNAs were too low to show any effect of E1A. We conclude that the LPS responsiveness of A549 pulmonary epithelial cells is altered by adenoviral E1A by upregulating IL-8. We speculate that this mechanism may be important in the amplification of the inflammatory process of lungs to other irritants
