In order to investigate whether polymorphism in gene for heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) has any bearing on individual susceptibility to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the geotypes of 88 patients with COPD and 87 healthy smoking control subjects were tested by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment polymorphism analysis for HSP70 gene. In COPD group, HSP70-1 genotype A/A, A/B and B/B was 59.1%, 35.2% and 5.7%, HSP70-2 genotype A/A, A/B and B/B was 26.1%, 54.6% and 19.3%, and HSP70-hom genotype A/A, A/B and B/B was 70.4%, 27.3% and 2.3% respectively. In the control group, it was 60.9%, 27.5% and 3.5%, 20.7%, 56.3% and 23.0%, and 54.0%, 42.5% and 3.5%, respectively. The frequency of polymorphic genetypes showed no difference between the COPD group and the control group (P>0.05). It was suggested that geneic polymorphism in HSP70 is not associated with development of COPD in Han nationality of China
