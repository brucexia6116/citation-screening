INTRODUCTION: The COPD airway is infiltrated with CD8+ T cells, which has led to a virus being implicated in its pathogenesis. Some investigators have suggested a role for the persistence of the adenovirus E1A in bronchial epithelial cells. We examined respiratory tract specimens from COPD patients for the presence of E1A DNA and mRNA using real-time PCR. METHODS: Nucleic acid extraction was performed on sputum specimens from patients with COPD. Copy numbers for GAPDH, and adenovirus 5 E1A DNA and mRNA were determined using a quantitative real-time PCR assay. All samples were screened for the adenovirus hexon gene using nested PCR. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-one patients, 80 male, aged 68.9+/-9.8 years with COPD were recruited. One hundred and thirty-six were seen during an exacerbation when admitted to hospital, 33 of whom were reviewed when clinically stable along with an additional 35 stable COPD patients. Ten patients in the exacerbation group were positive for the adenovirus hexon gene (7%), as were four in the stable group (6%). Only two patients in the exacerbation group were positive for adenovirus 5 E1A. Only one patient in the stable COPD group had detectable E1A DNA/mRNA and also tested positive for the adenovirus hexon gene. CONCLUSION: Adenovirus is detected in similar frequencies in exacerbated and stable COPD patients. Adenovirus E1A DNA is infrequently detected in respiratory secretions from patients with COPD. Our data suggest that the persistence of adenovirus 5 E1A in lung cells of sputum samples in patients with COPD occurs infrequently
