Glutathione S-Transferase P1 (GSTP1) is an important enzyme in the detoxification of products of oxidative stress. Several studies have shown an association of the amino acid variant Ile105Val with bronchial asthma and the reaction of the lung to inhalant pollutants. The aim of this study was to test the two known amino acid variants in GSTP1 for association with bronchial asthma and airway hyper-responsiveness in two German pediatric populations. We genotyped Ile105Val and Ala114Val in the Multicenter Allergy Study cohort (85 children with asthma, 123 controls) and asthmatic children from Freiburg (n = 178). We did not find association of either polymorphisms with bronchial asthma or airway hyper-responsiveness. We conclude from our data that polymorphisms within GSTP1 do not play a major role in the development of bronchial asthma in German children
