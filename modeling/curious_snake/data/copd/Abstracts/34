BACKGROUND: After lung transplantation patients frequently develop small airways disease. Exudative bronchiolitis (EB) has not been described previously in this population. We describe a case series of patients who have developed EB after lung transplantation. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical records and radiologic data of 99 patients who underwent single and bilateral lung transplantation. Data relating to ethnicity, transplant indication, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) status, complications and survival were recorded. The EB cohort, defined by high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) evidence of the disease, was compared with a group of patients who had not developed EB. RESULTS: The majority of patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n = 51), followed by cystic fibrosis (CF; n = 22), pulmonary fibrosis (n = 8), pulmonary hypertension (n = 7), bronchiectasis (n = 5), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n = 3) and Eisenmenger's syndrome (n = 3). Thirteen patients were found to have developed EB. EB was more commonly seen in Maori and Pacific Island patients (p < 0.05). EB was significantly associated with early infection post-transplant (p < 0.05) and a history of Aspergillus infection (p < 0.005) or diabetes (p < 0.05). The patients with EB were also significantly more likely to develop bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (p < 0.0005), bronchiectasis (p < 0.0005) or small airways disease (p < 0.05). Patients with EB had a varied response to treatment, with the majority showing improvement. CONCLUSIONS: EB was noted to occur after lung transplantation in a significant proportion of patients, but will not be detected unless HRCT is used routinely. It has been associated with patients' ethnicity, donor haplotype, infection and the development of airways disease. EB may be a prominent indicator of the likelihood of developing BOS
