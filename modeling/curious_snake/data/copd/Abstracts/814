An association between exon 3 polymorphisms of the gene encoding microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) and susceptibility to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been described. We have developed two methods for detecting polymorphisms at exons 3 (Tyr113-->His) and 4 (His139-->Arg) of the mEH gene based on different melting temperatures (T(m)) of fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotide hybridization probes using single-step assays that combine fluorescence PCR and melting curve analysis (LightCycler methodology). DNA was extracted from blood in 79 COPD patients and 146 healthy controls. Results were compared with those obtained by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis to detect Tyr113His variants and a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay for His139Arg detection. The T(m) of the exon 3 polymorphisms were 61.3 degrees C for Tyr113 (wild type) and 67.5 degrees C for His113 (mutant). The T(m) values of the exon 4 polymorphisms were 67.5 degrees C for His139 (wild type) and 59.2 degrees C for Arg139 (mutant). The within- and between-run melting peaks for the same allele differed by less than 0.5 degrees C for both the exon 3 and the exon 4 polymorphisms. Thus, melting analysis allowed easy and unambiguous assignment of genotyping by means of the respective melting curves. The proportion of individuals who were homozygous mutant for exon 3 was significantly higher in the COPD group than in the control group (p=0.004). LightCycler fluorescence genotyping of exon 4 polymorphisms correlated perfectly with SSCP results. RFLP assay classified 2 patients as homozygous mutant while LightCycler analysis genotyped them as heterozygous. DNA analysis by PCR and sequencing confirmed the LightCycler result. These high-speed (about 40 min for 32 samples), highly sensitive, and specific small-volume assays with low labor requirements hold great promise as tools for rapid detection of COPD susceptibility
