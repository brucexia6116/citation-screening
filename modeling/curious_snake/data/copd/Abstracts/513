G-401A polymorphism in RANTES promoter was associated with near-fatal asthma and atopic dermatitis in children. We studied whether gain-of-function mutations in RANTES gene were associated with asthma and atopy-related traits in Chinese children. Plasma total and aeroallergen-specific IgE concentrations were measured using micro-particle immunoassay and fluorescent enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to genotype RANTES G-401A and C-28G. One hundred and twenty-nine asthmatic children and 66 controls were recruited. Their mean logarithmic plasma total IgE concentrations were 2.53 and 1.98, respectively (P<0.0001). RANTES G-401A was not associated with physician-diagnosed asthma (P = 0.408). However, RANTES G-401A allele was significantly associated with IgE sensitization to cat (odds ratio 2.35; 95% CI 1.15-4.77; P = 0.010). Those homozygous for -401A had higher plasma cat-specific IgE levels (P = 0.034). Subjects having -401A were also more likely to have mold-specific IgE (odds ratio 3.82; 95% CI 1.24-12.14; P = 0.007). On spirometry, those with -401A/ A had lower forced expiratory volume in 1-s (FEV1; P = 0.044). RANTES C-28G was not associated with any outcome in this study. In conclusion, the gain-of-function mutation at -401 of RANTES promoter is associated with sensitization to cat and mold allergens and FEV1 in Chinese children
