An adult with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was monitored prospectively for 2 years. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae was isolated from sputum cultures at 22 of 23 monthly clinic visits. Analysis of the isolates, by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), revealed that the patient was colonized by 3 different strains during the 2-year period. The gene encoding outer-membrane protein (OMP) P2, ompP2, was amplified from sputum samples and selected strains obtained from this patient. Analysis of the ompP2 sequences, in combination with the PFGE patterns, indicated that ompP2 horizontal transfer between 2 strains occurred in the respiratory tract, between clinic visits 13 and 14. Observation of ompP2 horizontal transfer in the human respiratory tract has important implications for both the understanding of ompP2 diversity among strains and the future design of OMP P2-based vaccines
