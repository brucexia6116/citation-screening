In previous studies we demonstrated that the E1A DNA and proteins of group C adenovirus are present in excess in the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Because adenovirus EIA gene products are known to regulate the expression of many genes by interacting with cellular transcription factors, we postulated that E1A enhances the production of inflammatory mediators and exacerbates the inflammatory process in smokers' lungs. We reported that LPS-induced ICAM-1 expression in A549 cells is upregulated by E1A. In the current study we investigated whether this regulation is mediated through the ICAM-1 promoter. A549 cells and primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells were transiently cotransfected with a plasmid containing the ICAM-1 enhancer-promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene (pBS-CAT-P) and either a plasmid carrying the adenovirus 5 E1A gene (pE1Aneo) or a control plasmid (pneo). To compare the effect of transient versus stable E1A expression on the activity of this promoter, we also transiently transfected stable E1A-expressing A549 cells with pBS-CAT-P. Transient cotransfection of pE1Aneo and pBS-CAT-P had no effect on basal ICAM-1 promoter activity in A549 or HBE cells. After stimulation of A549 cells with TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, or LPS, promoter activity was increased by two- to threefold in the presence of adenovirus EIA. In HBE cells, on the other hand, E1A repressed the ICAM-1 promoter after stimulation with IFN-gamma and LPS with little change after TNF-alpha stimulation. In stable E1A transfectants, ICAM-1 promoter activity was 2 to 2.5 times higher than in control transfectants with or without stimulation with TNF-alpha or LPS. These findings suggest that EIA can modulate the activity of the ICAM-1 promoter in lung epithelial cells and this modulation is different in cells of alveolar origin compared to bronchial epithelial cells
