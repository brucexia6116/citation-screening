A deficiency in the plasma protease inhibitor alpha 1-antitrypsin can cause chronic obstructive emphysema or infantile liver cirrhosis. This deficiency results from a single amino acid substitution created by a G to A transition in the gene for alpha 1-antitrypsin. Chemically synthesized specific oligonucleotide probes (19-mer) have been used to develop a sensitive and direct test for the presence or absence of the mutant gene in any individual, which can be used for prenatal diagnosis of the deficiency syndrome
