Alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) due to homozygosity of the protease inhibitor (Pi) Z variant predisposes to childhood liver disease and pulmonary emphysema. About 10% of all neonates with AATD develop liver disease, and about 3% overall progress to severe disease. AATD is a principal genetic indication for liver transplantation in children. The liver pathology is associated with accumulation of abnormally folded protein in hepatocytes, the principal producers of circulating alpha(1)-antitrypsin (AAT). It is currently unknown why only a small proportion of Pi ZZ individuals progress to clinically significant cirrhosis. The AAT gene shows significant variation, and we hypothesized that cryptic genetic variants within the AAT gene may contribute to susceptibility to liver disease. In a case-control study consisting of 42 patients with established moderate-to-severe liver disease and 335 homozygous Pi ZZ patients who mostly presented with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 322: 242 index cases and 80 unaffected sibs) or were asymptomatic (n = 13) with no evidence of liver disease, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that conferred a significant risk for liver disease (P = 0.007). The frequency of the SNP was no different in 242 Pi ZZ cases with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared with 80 nonindex cases. The SNP therefore appears to confer susceptibility to liver disease, although reporter gene assays failed to show any functional differences between alleles. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of a genetic modifier of liver disease in homozygous ZZ children and has potential implications for screening and possible therapies that are currently being developed
