Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AT) is an autosomal recessive disease associated with chronic liver disease in adults and children and emphysema in adults. The disease is one of the most common inherited disorders of the Caucasian population of North Europe and North America and is the most common genetic reason for pediatric orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx), although it is a rare indication in adults. The natural history of the disease is unpredictable and the pathogenesis of the liver injury unclear. Thirty-five patients with histologically apparent alpha 1 AT accumulation in the liver (22 adults, 13 children) have been transplanted in this center. Clinical features were correlated with the pretransplant phenotype, serum alpha 1 antitrypsin levels and potential precipitating factors. All children were PiZZ homozygotes, most of whom had presented with neonatal hepatitis. The majority of adult patients were heterozygotes presenting with portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis. Current one-year posttransplant survival figures are 73% for adults and 87.5% for children. Replacement of the cirrhotic liver results in acquisition of the donor phenotype, a rise in serum levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin, and apparent prevention of associated disease
