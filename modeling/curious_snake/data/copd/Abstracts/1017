Ambient and biological monitoring was undertaken among tobacco processors who are chronically exposed to tobacco particulates via nasopharyngeal and cutaneous routes. Ambient monitoring revealed that the inspirable dust concentration was 150-fold higher in the tobacco factory than in the control environment, and was associated with chronic bronchitis in workers. Increased systemic exposure to tobacco constituents was evident from the high levels of cotinine, thioethers, promutagens and direct acting mutagens in workers' urine. The mean glutathione level and glutathione S-transferase activity were significantly lower in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of workers; however, the frequency of the GSTM1 null allele was similar to that in controls. A significant increase in chromosomal damage was noted in target and non-target cells of tobacco processors. In view of the association between tobacco use and several non-communicable diseases, the findings of the present study indicate an urgent need to minimize tobacco exposure among the processors
