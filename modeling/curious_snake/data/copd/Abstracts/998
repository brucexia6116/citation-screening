BACKGROUND: The antiproteases, including alpha-1-antitrypsin, are supposed to prevent lungs from becoming emphysematous. Genetic susceptibility to smoking injury may confer a risk for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: We have investigated the association between the polymorphism of alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (AACT), one of the antiproteases, and susceptibility to the development of COPD among heavy smokers. Blood samples obtained from both patients with COPD (n = 53) and control subjects (n = 65) at the Tokyo University Hospital, the Juntendo University Hospital and the Tokyo Kenbikyoin Clinic were used for this genotyping assay. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were performed to genotype the AACT biallelic polymorphism in the signal peptide (-15 alanine to threonine), and the two polymorphisms of the exon (Pro229Ala and Leu55Pro). RESULTS: The proportion of AACT/Ala-15 homozygotes was significantly higher in the COPD patients than in the control subjects (COPD 37.7% vs. control 18.5%). The odds ratio for AACT/Ala-15 homozygotes vs. all other genotypes was 2.7 (95% CI 1.2-6.2) for the COPD group. We could not find any association between the other two polymorphisms and COPD. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphism in the signal peptide of AACT may be associated with individual susceptibility to the development of COPD, because the AACT/Ala-15 genotype is predominantly found in patients with COPD. It is suggested that AACT/Ala-15 genotype may be less protective against smoking injury
