Activation of macrophages through CD14 by microbes is crucial in inducing immunity by type 1 T helper cells. A C-to-T polymorphism at position -159 of CD14 was associated with serum total IgE level in Caucasians but not in Japanese subjects. The objective of this study is to determine whether this polymorphic marker is associated with atopy and asthma phenotypes in Chinese children. Restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to characterize CD14/-159 genotypes. Microparticle immunoassay was used to measure serum total IgE level; fluorescent enzyme immunoassay was performed to measure serum concentrations of specific IgE to aeroallergens; and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure serum levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14). Lung function in asthmatics was assessed by spirometry. Two hundred and fifty-eight patients and 92 control children were recruited. Their mean serum total IgE concentrations were 331 and 74 kIU/l, respectively (p < 0.0001). Atopy, defined as the presence of at least one allergen-specific IgE in serum, was found in 220 (85%) patients and in 41 (45%) controls (p < 0.0001). Serum sCD14 levels were significantly associated with CD14/-159 genotypes (p = 0.004). Atopic subjects with CC genotype in CD14/-159 had the highest serum total IgE levels compared with CT and TT genotypes, with the respective mean values being 661, 427 and 380 kIU/l (p = 0.015). Similarly, a higher proportion of subjects with CC genotype had increased serum total IgE concentration (p = 0.039). This polymorphic marker was not associated with asthma or aeroallergen sensitization in our cohort. Our results suggest that the C-159T of CD14 was associated with serum total IgE concentration in atopic Chinese children
