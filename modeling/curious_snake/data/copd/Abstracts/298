OBJECTIVE: Many genetic variations have been suggested as genetic risk factors for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including single nucleotide polymorphisms in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) gene. We attempted to elucidate the association between TGFB1 genetic polymorphisms and COPD among Koreans. DESIGN: The genotypes of 102 male patients with COPD and 159 volunteers with similar distributions of age, sex and smoking intensity, as well as normal pulmonary function, were determined for three previously associated TGFB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), -10807G/A (rs2241712) and -509T/C (rs1800469), located in or near the promoter, and 29T/C (rs1982073), located in exon 1 of the TGFB1 gene. RESULTS: No significant associations between COPD and the three TGFB1 SNPs could be identified. In addition, the haplotypes composed of three TGFB1 SNPs were not associated with the presence of COPD. CONCLUSION: These results differ from previous reports involving Caucasians, and might reflect racial differences in the pathogenesis of COPD
