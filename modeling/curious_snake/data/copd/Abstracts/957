To examine whether children with a genetic predisposition to asthma are more likely to be afflicted with bronchiolitis, we studied 122 parents of infants who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis (index group) and 120 parents of children who had never suffered from this disease (control group). The parents underwent bronchial challenge testing with methacholine and skin prick testing with common airborne allergens, and gave blood specimens for measurement of serum total IgE. There was no difference in atopic status, as assessed by the prevalence of atopy (at least one positive response to the allergens tested) or by serum total IgE levels, between index and control parents. The prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) (concentration of methacholine causing a 20% reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec [PC20] < 18 mg/mL) was higher in index parents than in control parents (17.2% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.02). Bronchial responsiveness (BR) index was significantly higher in index parents than in control parents (1.135 +/- 0.088 vs. 1.104 +/- 0.071, p < 0.01). Parents of children who were hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis showed a higher level of BR, but not atopy. This suggests that in terms of BHR, there may be a genetic predisposition to the development of bronchiolitis
