The homozygous state of the alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) deficiency variant Z is associated with severe liver damage in early childhood and progressive lung emphysema in adulthood. A single base transition (G to A in codon 342) in exon V is causing the severe disease. The Glu342 to Lys342 mutation can be detected conventionally by isoelectric focusing (IEF) or on the DNA level by the newly developed method of temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE). It is the aim of this study to describe the TGGE technique, to compare the results with conventional IEF, and to discuss its efficiency for different diagnostic applications
