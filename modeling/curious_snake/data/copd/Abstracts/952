OBJECTIVE: To investigate the manifestations that heat shock proteins(HSPs) possess in the pathogenesis of asthma and chronic bronchitis. METHODS: Using reverse transcription-DNA polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we investigated the expression levels of HSP70, HSP90 alpha and HSP90 beta genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) at natural state and after heat shock in 14 healthy volunteers, 21 patients with asthma and 18 patients with chronic bronchitis. RESULTS: No HSP70 gene but HSP90 alpha and HSP90 beta expressions were found in non-heat-shocked PBMC of normal control; HSP90 alpha and HSP90 beta genes may be expressed in PBMC of patients no matter whether they were in acute episode or not. Expression of HSP70 was found in PBMC of patients in acute episodes and of three symptoms-free patients with Aas 3, step 2. No expression of HSP70 gene was found in PBMC of patients in convalescent period but in PBMC of patients in acute episode. HSP90 alpha and HSP90 beta genes were expressed in PBMC of the two patients groups; After heat shock, expressions of the three genes increased in amount significantly in PBMC of all normal controls and patients. CONCLUSION: Expression of HSP70 gene in PBMC of asthmatic patients and chronic bronchitis was different, indicating that HSPs, especially HSP70 might be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma
