The coding polymorphism (rs1130866) within the surfactant protein B gene is known to associate with certain respiratory abnormalities. We investigated, using spirometry and fluorescence-based PCR, whether this variant influenced pulmonary function in healthy, nonsmoking men. We found no association of pulmonary function with genotype at the rs1130866 locus
