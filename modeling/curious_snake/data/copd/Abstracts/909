Alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that can cause pulmonary emphysema and liver disease. We report here the case of a 59-year-old woman who was admitted to hospital for evaluation of jaundice. She had no history of hepatitis or childhood liver disease. She had never received a blood transfusion, nor had she abused drugs or alcohol. Transjugular liver biopsy was then performed and revealed a micronodular cirrhosis. Ten months later, because of persistent liver cell failure and ascites, she underwent an orthotopic liver transplantation. Investigation of alpha1AT system in the proband revealed a substantial decrease in serum alpha1AT associated with a low elastase inhibitory capacity. The Pi phenotype revealed a PiM-like profile. Sequencing of exons 1-5 demonstrated the presence of the M3 allele. Moreover, a triple nucleotide deletion was detected in exon 2 of one allele. This caused an "in-phase" frameshift, coding for a protein deficient in a single Phe residue, which corresponded to the Mmalton variant. After liver biopsy, periodic acid-Schiff-positive acidophilic bodies resistant to diastase digestion were observed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. These results demonstrated that our patient had a heterozygous M3Mmalton alpha1AT genotype related to a deficiency phenotype. This observation is the first of a patient with heterozygous Mmalton genotype associated with an alpha1AT deficiency that induced severe liver disease requiring orthotopic liver transplantation
