We previously found that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) DD genotype is associated with exaggerated pulmonary hypertension and disturbance of tissue oxygenation during exercise in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. This study was designed to compare the effect of oxygen administration on pulmonary haemodynamics and tissue oxygenation during exercise in COPD patients with different ACE genotypes. Forty-three COPD patients (II=16, ID=12, DD=15) underwent right heart catheterization, and then performed an exercise test with room air or oxygen. We measured pulmonary haemodynamic variables and indices of tissue oxygenation such as mixed venous oxygen tension (PVO2) and arterial lactate concentration, both at rest and after exercise. The magnitude of difference in mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance after exercise between breathing of room air and breathing of oxygen did not significantly differ among the three groups. PVO2 after exercise with room air or oxygen was significantly higher in patients with the II genotype than in those with the ID or DD genotype. In contrast, lactate concentration after exercise with room air or oxygen was significantly lower in patients with the II genotype than in those with the ID or DD genotype. Moreover, the magnitude of difference in PVO2 and lactate concentration after exercise between breathing of room air and breathing of oxygen was the II>ID>DD genotype. These findings suggest that the ability of oxygen administration to improve tissue oxygenation during exercise is associated with the ACE genotypes in COPD patients
