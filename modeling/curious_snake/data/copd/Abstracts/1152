In this study of cystic fibrosis (CF) gene mutations in Southern Sweden we found missense mutations in 12 out of 110 patients. These patients, as a group, differed from deltaF508 homozygotes by a higher frequency of pancreatic sufficiency and an older age at diagnosis as has been indicated in previous studies. In addition, lung function (vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)) tended to be better although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.13 for FEV1). For two mutations, S549I and T338I, our results differed from earlier reports. In our experience, S549I confers a milder phenotype and T338I a more severe one than previously reported. We conclude that each mutation should be treated separately when trying to correlate genotype with phenotype
