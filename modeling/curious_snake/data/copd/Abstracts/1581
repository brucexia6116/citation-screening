Three adults with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency are described. In two of the cases the deficiency was genetically determined (cases 1 and 2), and each demonstrated unusual features of the disease. The liver in case 1 (homozygous) showed cholangiolar hyperplasia which has been recorded only once before. Case 2 (heterozygous) had emphysema and cirrhosis, a combination not previously documented in a heterozygote, in addition to malabsorption. Case 3 represents a case of spurious alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency with cirrhosis included to emphasize the diagnostic improtance of phenotyping in such cases
