objective aim present study investigate expression levels heat shock proteins hsp mrna peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc patients asthma chronic bronchitis elucidate role hsp pathogenesis asthma chronic bronchitis method using reverse polymerase chain reaction expression levels hsp70 hsp90alpha hsp90beta genes pbmc normal state heat shock investigated results hsp70 gene hsp90alpha hsp90beta expressions pbmc normal controls hsp90alpha hsp90beta genes expressed pbmc patients independently acute episodes expression hsp70 pbmc asthmatic patients acute episodes patients aas NUMBER step NUMBER patients chronic bronchitis hsp70 gene expression pbmc patients convalescent period pbmc patients acute episode hsp90alpha hsp90beta genes expressed pbmc patient groups heat shock expressions genes increased significantly pbmc normal controls patients conclusion expression hsp70 gene pbmc asthmatic chronic bronchitis patients different indicating hsp especially hsp70 involved pathogenesis asthma transcription dna non heat shocked symptom free
