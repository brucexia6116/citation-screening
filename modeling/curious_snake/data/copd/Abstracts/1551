alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1-AT) deficiency is a hereditary condition transmitted as an autosomal codominant trait. Fully deficient homozygotes develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at an early age. It remains controversial whether heterozygotes develop some degree of airway disease at an early age which results in severe obstructive disease later in life. We studied 12 alpha1-AT-deficient members of a family spanning three generations by extensive pulmonary function tests, clinical history and genetic determinations. 3 of the subjects were homozygotes and showed important clinical and lung function abnormalities by the age of 30. Two out of 9 heterozygotes, a female and a male, had decreased dynamic compliance, elevated closing volume and low PaO2. 3 showed clinical and physiological abnormalities (elevation in functional residual capacity and residual volume, low FEV1/FVC and elevated closing volume); however, these alterations could be attributed to their smoking habits or concomitant medical condition. The remaining 4 subjects were normal. None of the heterozygotes showed alterations in the static elastic recoil of the lung or static compliance
