In order to assess the role of genetic factors and environmental influences in bronchial responsiveness, we studied the airway response to an inhaled bronchodilator in 66 nonasthmatic parents (age, 30.9 +/- 5.9 years) of infants with bronchiolitis (group 1). It was a placebo-controlled double-blind study. A control group (group 2) of healthy parents of infants who did not have bronchiolitis also were investigated with the test of bronchodilator response. All subjects showed normal expiratory airflow and lung volumes (forced vital capacity [FVC], forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1], and mean forced expiratory flow during the middle half of FVC [FEF25-75%] > 80 percent of predicted) at baseline forced expiratory maneuver. In 16 (24.2 percent) subjects of group 1, there was significant increase in at least one parameter after salbutamol administration, but not after placebo inhalation, with respect to baseline levels. Furthermore, no significant changes in FVC, FEV1, or FEF25-75% values were found in group 2. In conclusion, this study confirms that parents of infants with bronchiolitis have an enhanced airway responsiveness, greater than control parents. Further studies are needed to assess whether one may infer the outcome of infants with bronchiolitis from this characteristic in their parents
