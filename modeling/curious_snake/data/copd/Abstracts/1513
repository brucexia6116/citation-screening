Genetic deficiency of alpha 1-antitrypsin in man is a predisposing factor to emphysema and a disorder potentially correctable by somatic gene therapy. A full-length human alpha 1-antitrypsin cDNA was cloned into a retroviral vector and introduced into cells which package the recombinant gene in a retroviral capsule. Cells infected with the recombinant retrovirus express human alpha 1-antitrypsin mRNA and protein. The recombinant protein is glycosylated, secreted and exhibits anti-protease activity against human neutrophil elastase
