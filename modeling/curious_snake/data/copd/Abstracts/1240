Familial aggregation of ventilatory function has been described in several populations, but the effects of age and cigarette smoking on the extent of aggregation have not been well characterized. We used data from a survey of a Hispanic population in New Mexico to obtain estimates of heritability for FVC and FEV1 as percentages of predicted value. Product-moment correlations for FVC of spouse pairs were 0.18 (n = 90 pairs) if neither smoked, 0.013 (n = 45 pairs) if only the wife smoked, 0.18 (n = 118 pairs) if only the husband smoked, and -0.04 (n = 83 pairs) if both smoked. Correlations for FEV1 of spouse pairs were similar. Because parent-child correlations did not vary with sex, we calculated product-moment correlations from the pooled data. The parent-child correlations for nonsmoking parents with nonsmoking children 6 to 17 yr of age and living in the same house were 0.16 (n = 335 pairs) and 0.17 for FVC and FEV1, respectively. For parents whose children were 25 yr of age or older, the parent-child correlations for those living in different houses were 0.37 (n = 63 pairs) for FVC and 0.40 for FEV1 if neither smoked, and 0.24 (n = 27 pairs) for FVC and 0.14 for FEV1 if both smoked. Heritability estimates, estimated by path analysis, were 0.43 for FVC and 0.42 for FEV1 if neither family member smoked and 0.65 for FVC and 0.44 for FEV1 if both family members smoked. We conclude that there is a moderate degree of heritability of FVC and FEV1 with no substantial change based on age or smoking status
