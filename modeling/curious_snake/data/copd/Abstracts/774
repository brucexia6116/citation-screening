Mice with lung-specific expression of human matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) develop emphysematous changes similar to those seen in smoking-induced emphysema in humans. Morphometric analyses of three transgenic lines [homozygous colony (Col) 34, Col 50, and Col 64] with varying temporal expression of MMP-1 were undertaken to determine the validity of this animal as a model of adult-onset emphysema. Line 50 mice, which have early expression of MMP-1 (14 days postconception), exhibited morphometric changes by 5 days of age. In contrast, homozygous line 34 and 64 with delayed expression (birth and 2 wk of age) were normal up until 4 wk of age when progressive changes in their mean linear intercept were first noted. In contrast, heterozygous mice from line 34 with lower transgene expression did not develop emphysema until 1 yr of age. The changes in mean linear intercept coincided with an increase in lung compliance. Emphysema in these mice was associated with decreased immunostaining for type III collagen within the alveolar septa. This study provides evidence that MMP-1 induces progressive adult-onset emphysema by the selective degradation of type III collagen within the alveolar wall
