This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, (1) Compare the efficacy of infiltrated local anaesthetic agents with topically applied local anaesthetic agents for repair of dermal (skin) lacerations. We will determine anaesthetic efficacy by the patient's self-report of pain intensity during repair of the wound., (2) Compare the efficacy of various single or multi-component topical anaesthetic agents for repair of dermal lacerations., (3) Identify cocaine-free topically applied local anaesthetics that are potentially equally efficacious to cocaine-containing topical anaesthetics., (4) Compare the safety of the various topically applied local anaesthetic agents or preparations
