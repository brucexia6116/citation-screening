BACKGROUND: Hyperhidrosis can have profound effects on a patient's quality of life. Current treatment guidelines ignore disease severity. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to establish clinical guidelines for the recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of primary focal hyperhidrosis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A working group of eight nationally recognized experts was convened to develop the consensus statement using an evidence-based approach. RECOMMENDATIONS: An algorithm was designed to consider both disease severity and location. The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) provides a qualitative measure that allows tailoring of treatment. Mild axillary, palmar, and plantar hyperhidrosis (HDSS score of 2) should initially be treated with topical aluminum chloride (AC). If the patient fails to respond to AC therapy, botulinum toxin A (BTX-A; axillae, palms, soles) and iontophoresis (palms, soles) should be the second-line therapy. In severe cases of axillary, palmar, and plantar hyperhidrosis (HDSS score of 3 or 4), both BTX-A and topical AC are first-line therapy. Iontophoresis is also first-line therapy for palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis. Craniofacial hyperhidrosis should be treated with oral medications, BTX-A, or topical AC as first-line therapy. Local surgery (axillary) and endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (palms and soles) should only be considered after failure of all other treatment options. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines offer a rapid method to assess disease severity and to treat primary focal hyperhidrosis according to severity
