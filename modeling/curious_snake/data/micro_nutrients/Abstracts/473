Maternal nutrition may be one of the most important under-evaluated factors contributing to the contemporary rise in prematurity in the United States and other industrialized nations around the world. Slowed fetal growth has been repeatedly shown to be associated with preterm birth, in both singleton and twin pregnancies. Antecedents of impaired fetal growth include a wide variety of factors, including intergenerational effects, biological and social factors related to race and ethnicity, maternal pregravid weight and gestational weight gain, and iron and mineral status. An assessment of maternal nutritional status, including anthropometric factors, is an integral component of effective prenatal care, and may facilitate a reduction in prematurity. [References: 63]
