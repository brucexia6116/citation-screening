BACKGROUND: Vitamin E is a generic term used to describe the many derivatives of tocol and tocotrienol. It is the major lipid-soluble antioxidant in the skin and has been used as treatment for many skin conditions, including scarring. Studies have shown that vitamin E provides no benefit to the cosmetic outcome of scars. METHODS: The authors constructed and distributed a questionnaire among staff and students at their institution. Their aim was to determine patterns of use and prescription of vitamin E among staff and students and to determine the understanding of the properties and biological functions of vitamin E. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 208 staff and students, including 110 nonconsultant hospital doctors (52.89 percent), 61 nurses (29.33 percent), and 27 medical students (12.98 percent). Nearly 68 percent thought that vitamin E could be of use in improving the cosmetic appearance of scars, while 25 percent actually recommended vitamin E to patients to improve the cosmetic outcome of scars. Just under 40 percent were aware of the biological function of vitamin E, while 16.35 percent thought vitamin E had absolutely no effect on scarring. Of respondents, 21.64 percent had used vitamin E for their own scars; 31.11 percent of these said it was suggested by a doctor, while 6.67 percent said a pharmacist suggested it. CONCLUSIONS: Without scientific basis, health professionals continue to recommend vitamin E for use on scars. Such recommendations should not be made in the absence of evidence-based medicine
