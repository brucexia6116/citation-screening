Guidelines for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after hip replacement surgery suggest the use of twice-daily low-molecular-weight heparin as one treatment option. Danaparoid, a low-molecular-weight heparinoid, and once-daily enoxaparin are recently released dosage forms that have been evaluated as pharmacoprophylaxis for DVT after hip replacement surgery. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio calculations using published efficacy and safety data suggest that enoxaparin (40 mg) daily is the more cost effective of these two agents as routine prophylaxis after hip replacement surgery
