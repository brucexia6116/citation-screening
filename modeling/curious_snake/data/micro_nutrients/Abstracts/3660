Published literature comparing 31P MR brain spectra of bipolar patients to healthy controls was evaluated, focusing on phosphomonoester (PME)/phosphodiester (PDE) resonance areas because these metabolites are related to membrane phospholipids and membrane defects in bipolar disorder have been suggested. Studies comparing PME and/or PDE values of bipolar subjects to values observed in healthy controls were reviewed. Data from the studies meeting our inclusion criteria (8 reports involving 139 bipolar and 189 comparison subjects) were grouped according to the mood state of the subjects. Meta-analyses of data were performed to compare PME and PDE levels of euthymic bipolar patients to healthy controls, as well as comparing PME levels during euthymia in bipolar subjects to values observed during manic and depressed states. The PME values of euthymic bipolar patients were found to be significantly lower than PME values of healthy controls. Depressed bipolar patients had significantly higher PME values in comparison to euthymic bipolar patients. No significant difference could be detected between the PDE values of bipolars and controls. This meta-analysis found support for trait- and possibly state-dependent abnormalities of membrane phospholipid metabolism, which may reflect a dysregulation in brain-signal transduction systems of relevance in bipolar illness
