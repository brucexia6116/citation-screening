Background, The benefits of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) administration in dialysis patients have been demonstrated, however the optimal frequency regimen have yet to be established., Objectives, To assess the effects of different frequency regimens of rHuEPO administration in dialysis patients on anaemia correction, quality of life and optimal use., Search strategy, We searched 13 electronic databases (1980 to May 2001) the internet (August 1997), handsearched Kidney International (1983 to May 1997), contacted known investigators, biomedical companies, and screened reference lists of relevant articles., Most recent search: The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register (June 2004) and The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2004)., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing different frequencies of rHuEPO administration in dialysis patients. We compared haemodialysis and CAPD patients and subcutaneous and intravenous administration., Data collection and analysis, Quality assessment was performed by two assessors. Data were abstracted by a single author onto a standard form, and a sample was checked by another author. Results were expressed as relative risk (RR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)., Main results, Eleven studies (719 patients) were included. There was no significant difference in maintaining target haemoglobin for once versus twice weekly administration (one study, 20 patients: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.40) or mean haemoglobin after 12 weeks of therapy between haemodialysis and CAPD patients (two studies: WMD -0.21 g/dL, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.56) At the end of study for once versus thrice weekly administration (three studies: SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.06) and at the end of maintenance phase (one study: WMD -0.2 g/dL, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.25) there was no significant difference. More rHuEPO was required by haemodialysis patients receiving once weekly versus twice weekly doses (WMD 12.0 U/kg, 95% CI 0.24 to 23.76). No difference was found for CAPD patients alone or combined (WMD 4.38 U/kg, 95% CI -11.28 to 20.04). Once versus thrice weekly administration was not significant (WMD 10.00 U/kg, 95% CI -80.87 to 100.87). There was no difference in the frequency of adverse events., Authors' conclusions, There is no significant difference between once weekly versus thrice weekly subcutaneous administration of rHuEPO. Once weekly administration would require an additional 12 U/kg/wk for patients on haemodialysis, however this is based on one very small study. Cost of additional rHuEPO needs to assessed with regard to patient preference and compliance
