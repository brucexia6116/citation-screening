It has been suggested that proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the striatum can differentiate between parkinsonian syndromes. The present study aims to examine this claim by performing a systematic review of the existing literature. A MEDLINE search was performed between 1966 and October 1999, along with searches of conference abstracts and reference lists of papers identified. Eleven groups have used MRS to examine metabolite ratios in the striatum in Parkinsonian syndromes. A number of these have shown reduced N-acetylaspartate/choline (NAA/Cho) and/or N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) ratios in either idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal degeneration. However, the heterogeneity in the results precludes the use of any of these findings in differential diagnosis at the present time. The only group to use absolute metabolite concentrations rather than ratios showed that the decreased NAA/Cho ratio in IPD was because of an increase in choline which is of uncertain biological significance. Further large multicentre trials are required using absolute quantitation of tissue metabolite concentrations and a standardized technique. The patients entering such studies must be rigorously assessed to establish the diagnosis of the type of parkinsonism as accurately as possible. Any discriminatory abnormality must be tested in a large prospective study of newly presenting parkinsonian patients with long-term clinical follow up and ultimate pathological confirmation of the diagnosis as far as possible.
