AIMS: To determine laboratory and clinical benefit of oral acetylcysteine, as an adjunct to saline hydration, in chronic renal insufficiency patients undergoing coronary angiography. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively studied 80 patients with chronic renal insufficiency (mean [+/-SD] serum creatinine concentration 2.0+/-0.39mg/dl), who underwent coronary angiography with or without intervention. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either acetylcysteine (600mg orally t.i.d.) or placebo, in addition to intravenous 0.45% saline (1ml/kg of body weight per hour), 12h prior to and after coronary angiography. There was an increase of >/=0.5mg/dl in the serum creatinine concentration 48h after coronary angiography in seven of the 80 patients (9%): in four of the 41 patients (10%) in the acetylcysteine group and in three of the 39 patients (8%) in the placebo group (P=0.52). The incidence of in-hospital adverse clinical events (acetylcysteine, 5% vs placebo, 8%, P=0.47) and the length of hospital stay [acetylcysteine, median (interquartile range) 4 (2-4) days vs placebo, 2 (2-4) days, P=0.44] did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings do not support routine prophylactic administration of oral acetylcysteine as an adjunct to saline hydration for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in chronic renal insufficiency patients undergoing coronary angiography.
