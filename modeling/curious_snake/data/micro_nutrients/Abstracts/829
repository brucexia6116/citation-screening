Osteoporosis is a common but neglected problem in India. The major challenges to management are lack of awareness and resource constraints. The management is also hampered by the non-availability of normative data for bone mineral density in Indians. Subclinical vitamin D deficiency is widespread. The drugs available in the country include calcium, vitamin D, hormone replacement therapy, raloxifene, alendronate, risedronate, calcitonin and teriparatide. Bisphosphonates (alendronate) constitute the mainstay of treatment in India. There is a need for evidence based, context specific and resource sensitive guidelines. [References: 14]
