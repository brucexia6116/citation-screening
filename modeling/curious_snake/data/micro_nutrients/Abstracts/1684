Clinical trials continue to guide patient management. However, the hypotheses generally come from observational studies. Studies on women continue to be too little and too few, particularly in light of the fact that most elderly hypertensive patients are likely to be women. Attention has been drawn to the possibility that hypertension per se may engender symptoms such as headache for example, in addition to harder endpoints such as death. The MICROHOPE study, which was not a blood pressure-lowering study, showed that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with ramipril in diabetic patients provided the same beneficial effects previously published for the HOPE study. The doxazosin arm of the ALLHAT study was terminated by the data monitoring and safety board because the doxazosin-treated patients developed congestive heart failure at a greater rate than diuretic-treated patients. Two extensive studies testing two different classes of calcium antagonists against primarily diuretic-based treatment showed that the calcium antagonists were no less effective in terms of preventing hard endpoints. A small, but impressive cross-over study testing the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, against placebo showed that statin treatment lowers blood pressure in hypercholesterolemic patients with hypertension. Meta- analyses emphasized the value of blood pressure reduction in the elderly and added to the controversy and confusion about the role of calcium antagonists in the first-line treatment of hypertension. The point may be moot since with the current recommendations few hypertensive patients will be adequately treated with a single agent. [References: 24]
