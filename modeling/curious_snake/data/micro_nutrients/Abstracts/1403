OBJECTIVE: To determine the patterns of consumption in calcium channel blockers (CCB) groups in the Czech Republic between 1992 and 1999 and make a comparison with selected countries. METHODS: This was part of a drug utilization study using WHO methodology [Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification/defined daily doses (ATC/DDD)]. The wholesale data collected by drug distributors were used. Utilization was calculated as the DDDs for 1000 inhabitants per day. In focus was the consumption of short-acting nifedipine. Comparison with wholesale data from Finland, Norway, Germany and Australia was made. RESULTS: There was a decreasing tendency to use short-acting nifedipine in the Czech Republic over the period 1993-1999. Four years after publication of warning evidence, short-acting nifedipine still accounted for 23% of all calcium channel blockers in our country. The abundance of second-generation CCBs increased from less than 1% in 1993 to 43% in 1999. The consumption of short-acting nifedipine in the Czech Republic and Germany is probably three times more frequent than in Nordic countries and Australia. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of short-acting nifedipine in the Czech Republic 4 years after recognition of its risks still remains very high. This suggests that implementation of clinical trial results to clinical practice is very slow and ineffective
