OBJECTIVES: To determine the current practice of clinicians in the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis among men taking androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), because ADT leads to decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures. METHODS: We sent out a survey to Canadian urologists and radiation oncologists. The survey included questions about BMD testing, treatment practices, referral patterns, and risk of osteoporosis. RESULTS: The surveys were returned by 170 of 294 respondents (response rate 58%). Few respondents would obtain a baseline BMD in patients starting ADT. Forty percent would order a repeat BMD test after starting ADT if the baseline BMD were normal or unknown, but more than two thirds would if the baseline BMD showed osteoporosis. In men with a normal BMD starting ADT, respondents recommended weight-bearing exercises (58%), calcium (50%), vitamin D (47%), and bisphosphonate (6%) supplements. In men with osteoporosis at baseline, the use of nonprescription therapies increased slightly and bisphosphonate use increased to 44%. If osteoporosis were diagnosed, 11% would treat the patient themselves. The estimated risk of developing osteoporosis within 1 year of starting ADT with a normal baseline BMD ranged from 0% to 90% (median 20%). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first survey of its kind. The key findings included that few physicians would order a baseline BMD test, would prescribe bisphosphonates for prevention but almost one half would consider bisphosphonates to treat established osteoporosis, and wide variations exist in the practice patterns and risk perception surrounding ADT-related osteoporosis. Evidence-based guidelines are needed to help physicians deal effectively with osteoporosis prevention and management among men taking ADT
