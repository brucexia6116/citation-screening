A number of studies have shown that hyperuricaemia is associated with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease. It has been proposed that the elevated serum uric acid levels are linked to other risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes. Hyperuricaemia is commonly encountered in patients with essential hypertension and is considered as a risk factor for morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. In addition, lipid abnormalities (mainly hypertriglyceridaemia) are also found more frequently in hypertensive patients than in normotensives. There is evidence that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan, increases urate excretion by reducing reabsorption of urate in the renal proximal tubule. It is also known that fibric acid derivatives (fibrates) have several beneficial actions in addition to their lipid-lowering capacity. Fenofibrate administration is associated with a uric acid lowering effect. In this respect, we present two patients with hypertension and dyslipidaemia together with elevated serum uric acid levels. We also discuss (in the format of questions and answers) the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association of serum uric acid with cardiovascular disease, and we review the relevant literature to justify an evidence-based decision to choose an antihypetensive agent (losartan) or a lipid-lowering drug (fenofibrate) with an additional hypouricaemic effect
