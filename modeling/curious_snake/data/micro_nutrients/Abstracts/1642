This report updates the 1990 National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group Report on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy and focuses on classification, pathophysiology, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Using evidence-based medicine and consensus, this report updates contemporary approaches to hypertension control during pregnancy by expanding on recommendations made in the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI). The recommendations to use K5 for determining diastolic pressure and to eliminate edema as a criterion for diagnosing pre-eclampsia are discussed. In addition, the use of blood pressure increases of 30 mm Hg systolic or 15 mm Hg diastolic as a diagnostic criterion has not been recommended, as available evidence shows that women in this group are not likely to suffer increased adverse outcomes. Management considerations are made between chronic hypertension that is present before pregnancy and those occurring as part of the pregnancy-specific condition preeclampsia, as well as management considerations in women with comorbid conditions. A discussion of the pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in pregnancy includes recommendations for specific agents. The use of low-dose aspirin, calcium, or other dietary supplements in the prevention of pre-eclampsia is described, and expanded sections on counseling women for future pregnancies and recommendations for future research are included. Once again we thank Dr. Ray Gifford, Jr., and his committee for volunteering their time to produce this important report. We hope it helps the busy clinician prevent and manage a very important problem
