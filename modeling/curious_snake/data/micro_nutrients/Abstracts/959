PURPOSE: To analyze evidence-based information about alternative prophylactic pharmacological migraine treatments utilizing feverfew, butter-bur, magnesium, and riboflavin and to discuss the mechanism of action, dosage recommendations, side effects, and contraindications for each treatment. DATA SOURCES: Data obtained via electronic databases and professional medical references. CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical data support the use of fever-few, butterbur, magnesium, and riboflavin in migraine prophylaxis; however, studies are limited but promising regarding the participants' perceived relief. Studies with rigorous methodologies and larger sample sizes are needed to further support the safe and effective use of these treatments. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: With increased patient access to information regarding alternative migraine treatments, nurse practitioners (NPs) and other health care providers must be knowledgeable about evidence-based data regarding these alternative treatments to appropriately offer safe patient care.
