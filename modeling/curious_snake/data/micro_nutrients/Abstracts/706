Epigenetic mechanisms such as methylation of DNA, could lead to abnormal neurodevelopment and may be important in the etiology of schizophrenia. Maternal dietary folate intake may play a role in determining methylation levels. The MTHFR gene C677T polymorphism influences folate metabolism and intracellular availability of folate metabolites for methylation. We carried out a meta-analysis of MTHFR C677T genotype and schizophrenia risk, and found that TT homozygotes had a significantly increased risk, OR 1.48 (1.18-1.86). This supports the hypothesis that folate status is a determinant of schizophrenia risk. Larger studies of this issue are required, together with studies of maternal genotype which could identify whether maternal folate status during pregnancy is important. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc
