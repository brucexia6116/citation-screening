Hypertension is a common condition associated with increased mortality and multiple morbidities. Evidence based management of hypertension is known to improve both the short term and the long term outcomes in patients with this condition. There are several general measures and pharmacological agents that are known to treat hypertension adequately. Diuretics, in particular low dose thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, are widely used in the treatment of hypertension. They have excellent outcome data and high safety and low side effects profiles. In this article, the physiology, pharmacological actions, side effects, and outcome data of the use of diuretics in hypertension are reviewed. In addition, the effective use of diuretics in the management of hypertension is discussed. [References: 31]
