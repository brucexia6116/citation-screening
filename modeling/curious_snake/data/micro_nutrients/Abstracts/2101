We conducted a systematic review of all published randomized, controlled trials to assess the risk of cancer or death in patients receiving verapamil for hypertension, angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmias. Meta-analysis comparing the risk of new cancers, cancer deaths, and all deaths was performed. Thirty-nine trials comprising 11,201 patients were eligible. Study durations ranged from 8 days-6 years (mean 29.5 wks). Nine trials (6507 patients) were 24 weeks in duration or longer. For cancer and cancer death, OR was 1.20 (95% CI = 0.60-2.42) for verapamil versus active controls and 0.73 (95% CI = 0.39-1.39) for verapamil versus placebo. For all deaths, OR was 1.13 (95% CI = 0.70-1.82) for verapamil versus active controls and 0.85 (95% CI = 0.71-1.00) for verapamil versus placebo. Sensitivity analysis for the 9 trials 24 weeks' duration or longer gave similar results. There is no statistically significant increased risk of cancer or deaths with verapamil compared with active controls or placebo
