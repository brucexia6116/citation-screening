Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common complications after coronary artery bypass surgery. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of intravenous magnesium in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation. A meta-analysis of eight identified randomized controlled trials, reporting comparisons between magnesium and control was undertaken. The primary outcome was incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Our review revealed that use of intravenous magnesium is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery, with a relative risk of 0.64 (95% confidence interval = 0.47, 0.87, and p = 0.004).
