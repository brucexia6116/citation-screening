Osteoarthritis (OA) treatment is limited by the inability of prescribed medications to alter disease outcome. As a result, patients with OA often take food substances called nutraceuticals in an attempt to affect the structural changes that occur within a degenerating joint. The role of nutraceuticals in OA management can be defined only by an evidence-based approach to support their use. This paper reviews the clinical trials studying glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, vitamin C, vitamin E, and avocado-soybean unsaponifiables. It highlights the need for additional randomized, placebo-controlled trials to further define the utility of nutraceuticals in OA treatment. [References: 34]
