OBJECTIVE: To review the role of glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) solution in the management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1966-October 2001) database, using the search terms glucose, insulin, potassium, and myocardial infarction. STUDY SELECTION: Relevant English-language human studies and meta-analyses. DATA SYNTHESIS: Most studies that have investigated the use of GIK in AMI have been from the prethrombolytic era. Although most data trended toward favoring GIK in improving mortality and morbidity of AMI, the Polish GIK study was terminated prematurely because of an increase in mortality in patients treated with GIK. Dosage, duration of treatment, and route of administration of GIK varied among studies. CONCLUSIONS: Until results from larger-scale studies become available, the routine use of GIK infusion in AMI patients is not recommended. [References: 14]
