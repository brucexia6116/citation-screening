Several polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene have been implicated as risk factors for prostate cancer. We performed a meta-analysis of 14 studies (17 comparisons) with TaqI genotyping (1870 prostate cancer cases; 2843 controls), 6 studies (8 comparisons) with poly(A) repeat genotyping (540 cases; 870 controls), 5 studies with BsmI genotyping (987 cases; 1504 controls), and 3 studies with FokI genotyping (514 cases; 545 controls). The random-effects odds ratio (OR) for the t versus T allele was 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.86-1.05]. There was no suggestion of an overall effect either in recessive or dominant modeling, and the comparison of t/t versus T/T also showed no differential prostate cancer susceptibility (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.70-1.10). No effect of t was seen in subjects of European descent (nine comparisons; OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.08), Asian descent (five comparisons; OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.66-1.17), or African descent (three comparisons; OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.41-2.17). There was no between-study heterogeneity in any of these analyses. Overall, the random effects OR was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.75-1.18; no between-study heterogeneity) for the S versus L allele, 0.92 (95% CI, 0.63-1.35; P < 0.01 for heterogeneity) for the B versus b allele, and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.86-1.23; no between-study heterogeneity) for the f versus F allele. The meta-analysis shows that these four polymorphisms are unlikely to be major determinants of susceptibility to prostate cancer on a wide population basis
