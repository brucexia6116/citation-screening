PURPOSE: The purpose of this report was to describe the quantity of published literature and types of studies supporting the use of 4 pediatric dentistry procedures: (1) ferric sulfate pulpotomy; (2) stainless steel crowns; (3) space maintainers; and (4) atraumatic restorative technique (ART). METHODS: When available, titles and abstracts of reports written in English and published over a 36-year period (1966-2002) concerning these procedures were retrieved from MEDLINE. They were classified using a modified classification scheme that, in addition to the study designs, also considered the 4 dimensions of measuring dental outcomes. RESULTS: The quantity of available literature concerning each dental procedure varied considerably. Even though many reports were published on treatments, only a small proportion of the published literature for each procedure was found to evaluate outcomes, regardless of outcome dimension. Besides outcomes evaluations, studies on techniques, material properties, and review articles comprised a large proportion of the literature. Clinical dimension of outcomes was most commonly studied. Case series and case reports were the most frequently used study designs to report outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes-related literature to support some of the commonly performed treatments is limited both in quantity and study types. More reports are needed to develop the evidence base to support the commonly performed procedures in pediatric dental practice. Additional analyses reporting of the literature are also needed to assess internal and external validity of the studies
