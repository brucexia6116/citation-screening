If we are to provide periconception care to all American men and women of reproductive age, we must consider it all "routine visits." For prevention of birth defects, all reproductive-age women should be counseled about folic acid supplementation and rubella immunity. Many clinicians consider risk reduction and anticipatory activities important in periconception care. This includes counseling families about avoiding tobacco and substance abuse, using passenger restraints, avoiding teratogens, seeking appropriate genetic counseling and early prenatal care, and a variety of other periconceptional health issues. Reproductive-age women with underlying medical problems should be identified and counseled about pregnancy risks. [References: 72]
