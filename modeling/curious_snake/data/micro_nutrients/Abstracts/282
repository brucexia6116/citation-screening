Bacterial colonization and infection are important factors in compromised wound healing, particularly in chronic wounds. Although "best practice" for controlling these factors currently is not defined, systemic antibiotics are generally accepted as the preferred choice for treating infection, provided ischemia does not reduce their bioavailability. However, widespread use of systemic and topical antibiotics is associated with the emergence of resistant bacterial strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Colonization of wounds presents a double problem--potentially delayed healing and a potential source for cross-contamination. The judicious use of dressings, notably those containing certain antiseptic agents, can be a valuable option to control infection and promote healing. A review of the literature underscores the importance of considering the antiseptic route as part of a concerted approach to wound management and infection control. [References: 180]
