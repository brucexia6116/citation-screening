Fasting before surgery is necessary to avoid the risk of regurgitation and vomiting; it is also a legal requirement. But the current practice of fasting overnight or up to eight hours before surgery can cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, malnutrition and general malaise. Evidence shows that patients can benefit from receiving clear liquids up to three hours before surgery. Health care professionals need to be brought up to date with the latest evidence-based practice; national introduction of clear guidelines would help in this respect. [References: 24]
