Zeel comp. N (Zeel) is a homeopathic medication that has been widely used for many years for the treatment of arthritic disorders in a large number of countries worldwide. In recent years, a growing body of clinical and molecular evidence has been accumulating that shed light on the possible antiarthritic effects of this preparation. A number of studies report anti-inflammatory effects from Zeel. In vitro studies have indicated Zeel-mediated inhibition of the pathways involving the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, and also the 5-lipoxygenase pathways, affecting levels of both eicosanoids and leukotrienes. Thus, Zeel may reduce the main two classes of molecules responsible for arthritic pain and inflammation. This review describes recent research on Zeel and discusses the need for further studies to clarify the role of the compound in the antiarthritic armamentarium of complementary medicine.
