OBJECTIVE: To provide an evidence-based overview of drug treatment for long-term secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI). DATA SOURCES: We conducted searches of MEDLINE (1966-August 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, and the reference list of each identified study. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Trials and meta-analyses were included using the following criteria: (1) randomized trials, (2) description of identification procedure, inclusion criteria, outcome measures, and statistical methods, (3) confirmed MIs, (4) treatment continued for at least 1 month, and (5) all-cause mortality as primary outcome; other events as secondary outcomes. All authors interpreted the results from trials that met the inclusion criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: In randomized clinical trials, low-dose aspirin, high-intensity oral anticoagulants, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and statins decreased the risk of mortality and reinfarction after MI. Randomized clinical trials using calcium-channel blockers, antiarrhythmics, and hormone replacement therapy did not show benefits in patients with prior MI. Effects of the combined use of aspirin or oral anticoagulants with beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors plus statins must be derived from subgroup analysis of trials, but seem to be beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: The use of at least aspirin or an oral anticoagulant, a beta-blocker or an ACE inhibitor, plus a statin should be incorporated in the treatment routine. Clopidogrel treatment might be an alternative to aspirin. Standard addition of a beta-blocker to ACE inhibitor-treated patients without reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction seems to be untimely
