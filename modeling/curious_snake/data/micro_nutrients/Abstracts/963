BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Excessive anticoagulation is a frequent complication of anticoagulant therapy. The risk of hemorrhage approximately doubles for each one point increase in the International Normalized Ratio (INR) above 3.0. Reducing a prolonged INR to within the desired therapeutic range requires that oral anticoagulants be withheld. In addition, vitamin K may be administered. Since this latter treatment can produce rapid reductions in the INR, it must be carefully tailored to meet individual needs, balancing the risk of bleeding against the potential risk of causing thromboembolism. METHODS:To review available literature on the management of coumarin-associated coagulopathy in asymptomatic patients, a Medline search was carried out and papers published in English from 1966 and 2003 were identified. All available information on the management of asymptomatic patients presenting with coumarin-associated coagulopathy was analyzed. RESULTS: Following the results of clinical studies that only used an elevated INR as a surrogate end-point for the risk of bleeding, low dose oral vitamin K appears as the preferable strategy for rapidly restoring therapeutic INR levels in asymptomatic patients who present with an excessively prolonged INR due to warfarin therapy. For the treatment of patients with asymptomatic acenocoumarol-induced coagulopathy, vitamin K does not add any benefit to the strategy of simply withholding oral anticoagulant treatment. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Large randomized trials using clinical end-points are now required to provide evidence-based treatment recommendations for patients with coumarin-associated coagulopathy.
