This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, The objective of this review is to compare, from the best available evidence, the effects of umbilical vein injection of a saline solution alone or with any uterotonic drug versus an alternative solution with or without any other uterotonic agent or expectant management or any other method for routine management of the third stage of labour, on maternal and perinatal outcomes. We will only consider management of third stage of labour when the umbilical vein injection is administered within 15 minutes after the delivery of the baby., Additional subgroup analyses for the main outcomes will be based on the following characteristics:, total volume administered;, volume of oxytocin administered;, method of injection (catheter, syringe, milked, etc)
