Background, Glucocorticosteroids have been suggested for primary sclerosing cholangitis, which is characterised by chronic inflammation and fibrosis in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree., Objectives, To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of glucocorticosteroids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis., Search strategy, We searched , on , , from their inception until March 2003, and reference lists., Selection criteria, Randomised clinical trials comparing any dose or duration of glucocorticosteroids versus placebo, no intervention, or other immunosuppressive agents. We included trials irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status., Data collection and analysis, Both reviewers extracted data independently and assessed the methodological quality by the generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, double blinding, and follow-up. The results of the meta-analyses were presented as relative risks or weighted mean difference (WMD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary outcome measures were mortality and liver-related morbidity., Main results, Two randomised clinical trials were eligible for inclusion. One trial compared biliary lavage with hydrocortisone versus saline in 17 patients. A significant number of adverse events (pancreatitis; cholangitis with septicaemia; paranoid ideas; fluid retention) and no cholangiographic improvement led to termination of the trial. The other trial compared budesonide versus prednisone in 18 patients. Patients had significantly higher serum bilirubin concentration after treatment with prednisone compared with budesonide (WMD 10.4 [mu]mol/litre, 95% CI 1.16 to 19.64 [mu]mol/litre). No other significant effects on clinical or biochemical outcomes were identified for any of the evaluated interventions., Authors' conclusions, There is no evidence to support or refute peroral glucocorticosteroids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis
