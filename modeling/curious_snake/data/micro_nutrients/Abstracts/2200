The paper discusses the controversial attitude regarding the safety of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), especially of the dihydropyridine nifedipine, induced through several meta-analyses of studies with CCBs by Dr. Furberg et al.; as a result, a detrimental effect of CCBs, especially during acute myocardial infarction, has been claimed. Several independent re-analyses of the 16 studies, all performed in the 1980s and mainly using the short-acting nifedipine capsule, did not confirm Furberg's results and showed an insignificant mortality difference between patients on CCBs versus those on control. Nevertheless, new safety studies applying long-acting CCBs (half-lives of 1 or more days) combined with efficacy assessments are necessary, both in hypertension as well as coronary artery disease, to finally clear up this important question
