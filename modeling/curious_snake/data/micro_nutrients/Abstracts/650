As our population ages, the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) will increase dramatically. A number of therapies have been investigated for the treatment and prevention of AD. Clinicians should be prepared to provide evidence-based answers to inquiries regarding AD treatment. There is insufficient evidence to recommend ginkgo biloba, estrogen, statins, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention or treatment of AD. The use of vitamin E is supported by a single randomized controlled trial, while data on other antioxidants is mixed. There is good evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are modestly effective in the treatment of AD. Cholinesterase inhibitors appear to be effective throughout the spectrum of AD, while memantine, alone or in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors, is effective in late stage disease. There is insufficient evidence to suggest superiority of one cholinesterase over another. [References: 100]
