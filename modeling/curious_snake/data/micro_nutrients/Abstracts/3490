This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, The primary objective of this review is to determine the effect of heparin-bonded CVCs on the duration of catheter patency in children., Secondary objectives are to determine the effect of heparin-bonded catheters on the following., 1. CVC-related thrombosis (determined by color-coded Doppler ultrasonography or venography)., 2. Occlusion of CVCs (defined as inability to infuse fluids through the catheter due to blockage)., 3. Episodes of CVC-related sepsis and CVC-related colonization (CVC-related sepsis will be defined as the presence of symptoms and signs suggestive of sepsis, accompanied by positive blood cultures obtained from a normally sterile site different to the CVC, and from the CVC or CVC tip, each growing the same micro-organism; CVC-related colonization will be defined as the presence of micro-organisms in the CVC only and not from another sterile site)., 4. Number of additional CVC insertions., 5. Abnormality of coagulation profile., 6. Allergic reactions to heparin., 7. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) (development of thrombocytopenia after insertion of heparin-bonded CVC in an infant with a previously normal platelet count after exclusion of all other causes of thrombocytopenia, and a positive antibody test)., 8. Hemorrhage from any site in the body., 9. Osteoporosis with long-term use., 10. Mortality
