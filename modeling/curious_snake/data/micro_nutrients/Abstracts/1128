Calcium antagonists (calcium channel blockers) are widely used in the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. The results of a large number of clinical trials have demonstrated that calcium antagonists are as efficacious as other classes of antihypertensive agents in decreasing blood pressure in the elderly patients. Large clinical trials have shown the effectiveness of calcium antagonists (with long duration of action) in reducing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in elderly hypertensive patients. The calcium antagonists are a chemically, pharmacologically and therapeutically heterogeneous group of agents. Among themselves, they differ in vasoselectivity, effect on cardiac conduction, sympathetic activation, adverse effect profile, ability to protect against target organ damage, suitability for patients with co-morbid conditions, and pharmacodynamic characteristics. The calcium antagonists can be used as single agents or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. These drugs should not be used as first-line drugs in treating high blood pressure in patients with heart failure, since drugs in other classes provide more benefits. The dihydropyridine calcium antagonists should not be used in post-myocardial infarction patients or in patients with unstable angina; however, non-dihydropyridines may be used in such patients. The adverse effects of dihydropyridines include peripheral and ankle edema, flushing and headache. The short-acting preparations of the older calcium antagonists are no longer used, because of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcome. [References: 139]
