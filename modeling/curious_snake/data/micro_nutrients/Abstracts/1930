Present study analyses nephroprotective effect of various therapeutic interventions at different stages of kidney involvement in diabetes mellitus. A MEDLINE search of past 10 years data on various experimental studies, controlled clinical trials, meta-analysis and editorials pertaining to nephroprotection in diabetes mellitus was made. Effect of various therapeutic interventions such as metabolic glycaemic control, restricted protein diet and antihypertensive drugs (especially ACE inhibitors) has been analysed on the progression of different stages of kidney involvement in diabetes mellitus such as normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, diabetic nephropathy and end stage renal disease (ESRD). An attempt has been made to analyse differential long-term impact of various therapeutic interventions in relation to type of diabetes mellitus (i.e., IDDM and NIDDM) and associated hypertension. Progression of IDDM patients having microalbuminuria or diabetic nephropathy with or without hypertension has improved during the past decade largely because of adequate glycaemic control and effective antihypertensive treatment with conventional drugs e.g. beta-blockers and calcium antagonists, and more so due to the use of ACE inhibitors e.g. captopril, enalapril etc. Superiority of ACE inhibitor tends to decline from normotensive stage to the degree of rise in systemic blood pressure. However, data in NIDDM patients suffering from diabetic nephropathy is incomplete and inconclusive
