This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, To determine whether, in preterm or low birth weight infants following hospital discharge, feeding with calorie and protein-enriched formula milk versus human breast milk improves growth and development., In separate comparisons, we will compare feeding with calorie and protein-enriched formula milk versus human breast milk in infants fed formula milk exclusively, and in human breast milk-fed infants who are fed formula as supplement., If the data are available, we will undertake sub-group analyses of:, 1. infants of very low birth weight (less than 1.5 kilograms) or who are very preterm at birth (less than 32 weeks), 2. infants who remain small for gestational age (less than 10th percentile for weight) at hospital discharge, 3. infants with chronic lung disease requiring home supplemental oxygen therapy, 4. trials comparing feeding with calorie and protein-enriched formula milk versus donated expressed breast milk, 5. trials comparing feeding with calorie and protein-enriched formula milk versus expressed breast milk fortified with one or more the following components: protein, fat, carbohydrate, or minerals (calcium and/or phosphate), 6. trials in which infants receive "preterm" formula (energy content between greater than 75 Kcal/100ml and protein content at least 2.0 grams/100ml) versus human breast milk, 7. trials in which infants receive "post-discharge" formula (energy content between 72 and 75 Kcal/100ml and protein content at least 1.6 grams/100ml, but less than 2.0 grams/100ml) versus human breast milk
