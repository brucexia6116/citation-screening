There is evidence based on nitrogen balance that dietary cystine spares, from approximately 16% to 89%, the total methionine requirement. In a previous study we did not detect, by tracer techniques, a sparing effect of cystine when the diet provided methionine at a limiting intake (requirement level: 13 mg.kg-1.d-1). One reason could be that we used an intravenous infusion of the tracer, which may not, therefore, have labeled the carbon dioxide derived from the splanchnic oxidation of dietary methionine. The aim of this study was to compare methionine metabolism and oxidation in eight healthy adults given for 6 d each of three different diets: 13 mg (87.0 mumol) methionine.kg-1.d-1 and no cystine (diet A); 5 mg (33.5 mumol) methionine.kg-1.d-1 and no cystine (diet B); and 5 mg (33.5 mumol) methionine.kg-1.d-1 and 6.5 mg (52.4 mumol) cystine.kg-1.d-1 (diet C). On day 7, tracers ([1-13C, methyl-2H3]methionine and [2H2]cysteine) were administered orally at 30-min intervals for 8 h. Blood and breath samples were obtained for analysis during 3-h fasting and consecutive 5-h feeding periods. During fasting, methionine oxidation and methionine methyl (Qm) and carboxyl (Qc) fluxes and plasma concentrations were not affected by the amount of sulfur amino acids in the three diets. In the fed state methionine oxidation was significantly lower during diets B (3.0 +/- 0.5 mumol.kg-1.h-1) and C (2.8 +/- 0.6 mumol.kg-1.h-1) than during diet A (4.1 +/- 0.9 mumol.kg-1.h-1); there were no significant differences between diets B and C. Qm and Qc decreased with decreased methionine intake but no effect was observed by adding cystine. Cysteine flux (Qcys) was not affected by diet composition but it was lower during feeding than during fasting. In conclusion, replacing approximately 60% of the total requirement for methionine with cystine over a short diet period did not result in a detectable sparing of methionine oxidation
