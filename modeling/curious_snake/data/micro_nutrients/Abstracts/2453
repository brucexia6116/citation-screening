The evidence reviewed here supports the hypothesis that metal catalyzed oxidation reactions occur in the lens and may make a significant contribution to the changes seen in the lens with age and in cataract formation. The major support for this hypothesis is as follows. (1) All of the components of the non-enzymic metal catalyzed oxidation systems are present in the lens normally. Ascorbate, glutathione and oxygen are present in much lower concentrations. Although, even at low concentrations, the reactions could occur over many years with significant consequences. Components of some of the enzymic systems are also present, although primarily in the epithelial layer and outer cortical region. Copper and iron levels may be increased in some cataracts. (2) Protein carbonyl derivatives are increased in both aging and cataractous lenses. Amino acid-derived protein carbonyl derivatives have only been demonstrated in oxidative reactions derived from oxygen radical generation, particularly those catalyzed by metal-catalyzed oxidation systems. (3) Treatment of isolated bovine crystallins with metal catalyzed oxidation systems generates modifications similar to those found in vivo. The proposed mechanism of site-specific metal catalyzed oxidation appears to be a feasible mechanism of oxidation in the lens, and verification of the mechanism requires further study. Although the focus of this manuscript has been on the oxidative modification induced in proteins,m oxidative damage to DNA or membrane resulting from similar mechanisms may also play an important role in alteration of lens function during aging and cataractogenesis.
