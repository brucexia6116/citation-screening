PURPOSE: To report an Australian series of macular hole surgery by pars plana vitrectomy and fluid-gas exchange, and to identify factors influencing the outcome of the surgery through meta-analysis of the literature. METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive cases of macular hole were treated by pars plana vitrectomy, fluid-gas exchange and face-down positioning for at least 7 days, and prospectively followed for 3-12 months. Thirty-six reports of macular hole surgery were reviewed. A meta-analysis on the pre- and postoperative parameters was performed on 389 cases, in which case-specific data-points were available. RESULTS: In the current series, anatomical closure was achieved in all (100%) of 16 stage 2, and in 35 (87.5%) of 40 stage 3 or 4 macular holes. At least 2 logMAR lines of improvement in visual acuity were seen in 10 (62.5%) stage 2 and 20 (50.0%) stage 3 or 4 holes. Postoperative visual acuity was 6/12 or better in 10 (62.5%) stage 2 and 17 (42.5%) stage 3 or 4 holes. In both the current series and the meta-analysis, favourable surgical outcomes were associated with stage 2 macular holes, better preoperative visual acuity, and shorter preoperative duration. Adjuvant use was associated with a higher rate of anatomical closure but there was no clear benefit in terms of postoperative visual acuity. CONCLUSION: Our experience and the results of the meta-analysis suggest that macular hole surgery should be offered as early as possible once full-thickness neuroretinal defect occurs
