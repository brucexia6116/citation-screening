Recent publications, including new population-based studies and a meta-analysis of prospective, population-based studies, provide strong evidence for an elevated triglyceride level as an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. Pathophysiologic relationships between elevated triglyceride levels and both reduced high-density lipoprotein levels and an increase in the proportion of low density lipoproteins that are small and dense support the epidemiologic data, and suggest that an elevated triglyceride level should constitute a target for lipid-lowering therapy. There are no clear recommendations for management of patients with hypertriglyceridemia available in the current treatment guidelines. Treatment options include life-style measures and, if drug therapy is required, nicotinic acid, fibrates, more potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), or combination therapy with statin plus fibrate or nicotinic acid.
