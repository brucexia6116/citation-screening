Newborn care in the first 24 hours of life has been based on tradition for many years. Nurses recognize that many practices are not based on good scientific evidence and are not individualized. Instead, all newborns are treated as though they acquire potential pathogens during birth and are oblivious to noxious interventions such as intramuscular injections and heel sticks. In this article, obtaining blood samples from heel sticks and administering vitamin K and prophylaxis for ophthalmia neonatorum are presented as practices that require scrutiny by nurses to promote evidence-based care of newborns in the 1st day of life.
