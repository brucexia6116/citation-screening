This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, To characterize the relative effect of long-term oral anticoagulant treatment versus antiplatelet therapy on major vascular events in patients with non-valvular AF and no history of stroke or TIA. Our main hypotheses are:, (1) oral anticoagulant treatment compared to antiplatelet therapy will reduce ischemic events: ischemic strokes, myocardial infarction, systemic emboli, and vascular death (with a smaller decrease in all-cause death);, (2) oral anticoagulant treatment compared to antiplatelet therapy will increase bleeding events: intracranial hemorrhage and major extracranial hemorrhage;, (3) oral anticoagulant treatment compared to antiplatelet therapy will decrease clinically relevant combinations of ischemic plus bleeding events: all stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic), disabling or fatal stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic), and the composite of all stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death
