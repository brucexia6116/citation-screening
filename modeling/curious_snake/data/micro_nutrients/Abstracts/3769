Daily intake of 400 microg of folic acid before conception can reduce by approximately 80% the risk for having an infant with a neural tube defect (NTD) such as spina bifida or anencephaly. Although other risk factors for NTDs exist, such as diabetes, obesity, and family history of NTDs, prevention measures have focused predominantly on promoting folic acid consumption. Women can ensure they are consuming the recommended amount of folic acid by eating one serving of breakfast cereal fortified with 100% of the recommended daily value of folic acid or by taking a supplement with 400 microg folic acid daily. Annual surveys conducted for the March of Dimes (MOD) Birth Defects Foundation indicate that 40% of all U.S. women of reproductive age (i.e., aged 15-45 years) took supplements containing folic acid in 2007 (MOD, unpublished data, 2007), up from 28% in 1995. To analyze trends in folic acid-containing supplement intake among California women aged 18-44 years during 2002-2006, the California Department of Public Health conducted trend analyses of data from the California Women's Health Survey (CWHS). This report summarizes the results of those analyses, which indicated that although the overall prevalence of intake of folic acid-containing supplements remained stable from 2002 (40%) to 2006 (41%) in California, use of such supplements decreased among Hispanic women and women with less education. Downward trends among Hispanic women are of particular concern because 1) Hispanic women are at increased risk for having a fetus or an infant with an NTD compared with women of other races/ethnicities, 2) the number of births to Hispanics in California increased during 1993-2003, and 3) Hispanics accounted for nearly 52% of all births in California in 2005 (California Department of Public Health, unpublished data, 2005). Development of additional targeted and evidence-based public health interventions for increasing folic acid intake among these populations is needed
