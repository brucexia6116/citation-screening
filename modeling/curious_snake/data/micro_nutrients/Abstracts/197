OBJECTIVE: To apply meta-analysis to compare the clinical and radiographic effects of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) with formocresol (FC) when used as wound dressing for pulpotomy of primary molars. STUDY DESIGN: The study list was obtained by searching MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and SCI. Only those papers that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. There was significant difference between the success rates of FC- and MTA-treated pulpotomized primary molars (P < .05). Clinical assessments and radiographic findings of the MTA versus FC pulpotomy suggested that MTA was superior to FC in pulpotomy resulting in a lower failure rate, with the RR (Relative Risk) being 0.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11 to 0.90) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.74), respectively. Internal root resorption happened less in the MTA group with RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.77. CONCLUSION: MTA induces less undesirable responses and might be FC's suitable replacement. [References: 40]
