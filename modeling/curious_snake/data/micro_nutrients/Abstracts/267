This brief article is a response to the article by Monge et al. on page 326 entitled Reappraisal of 2003 NKF-K/DOQI guidelines for management of hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease patients. We contend that there is insufficient evidence to support the changes to clinical practice and clinical practice guidelines proposed by Monge and colleagues. We recommend that clinical trials be conducted to resolve these points of contention and other critical issues in the management of disorders of mineral metabolism in chronic kidney disease, including secondary hyperparathyroidism. The focus should be on evaluating the effects of alternative strategies on survival, as well as clinical manifestations of cardiovascular and bone disease
