OBJECTIVE: Implementation of preventive services guidelines is performed inconsistently. In an attempt to reduce variation in guideline implementation, we developed a patient questionnaire based on the US Preventive Services Task Force Guide and the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set 3.0 performance measures of the National Committee on Quality Assurance. SUBJECTS: 100 hospitalized patients of five primary-care physicians. METHODS: In a pilot study, 100 hospitalized patients of five primary-care physicians were questioned about their compliance with evidence-based, preventive healthcare recommendations. Information was requested on blood pressure measurement, cholesterol screening, fecal occult blood testing, smoking-cessation counseling, Pap testing, mammography, postmenopausal hormonal replacement therapy counseling, prostate examination and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, use of aspirin and beta-blockers following an acute myocardial infarction, testing of diabetics for hemoglobin A1c and retinal eye examinations, questioning of the elderly for auditory and visual problems, and receipt of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Information on variations from the recommended preventive service was fed back to their physicians. Six months after the initial survey, the patients were requestioned to determine if compliance had improved with the recommendations. RESULTS: We found significant improvement in fecal occult blood testing, smoking cessation, Pap smear testing, mammography use, prostate examinations and PSA testing, hemoglobin A1c testing, seeing or hearing loss follow-up, and the administration of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: Improving implementation of preventive services recommendations is a challenge. This pilot study suggests that involving the patient more in the process and informing the physician of the results may improve the process
