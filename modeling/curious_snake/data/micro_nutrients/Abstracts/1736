Dietary intervention trials using coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality and morbidity as endpoints have demonstrated that restriction of dietary total and saturated fat or replacement of the latter with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in particular n-3 PUFAs, is of great benefit with respect to CHD risk. This is likewise the case for intervention trials using angiographic endpoints, with many studies showing that such diets not only retard progression of coronary atherosclerosis but can cause regression as well. The role that antioxidants, such as vitamin E, may play in the development and progression of CHD is less clear. The results of large-scale clinical trials evaluating the effect of vitamin E supplementation on CHD risk do not support the concept that this agent is cardioprotective. The purpose of this report is to review dietary intervention trials that support a direct relationship between diet, lipoproteins, and CHD risk. [References: 48]
