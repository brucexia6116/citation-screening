OBJECTIVE: Enhance the pharmacist's ability to recognize and make treatment recommendations for the safe use of vitamins and supplements for an ambulatory, postmenopausal woman with cardiovascular disease. DATA SOURCES: Literature listed in MEDLINE, IDIS, and PubMED, with emphasis on material published since 2002, were reviewed. An online search of government and proprietary nutrition Web sites as well were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION: Literature reports were selected for their clinical relevance with emphasis on randomized, controlled trials, meta-analyses, cohort studies, and information from the American Heart Association and the Food and Nutritional Board of the Institute of Medicine. DATA EXTRACTION: An outline was developed and literature reports were separated into the categories of vitamins, minerals, and supplements. DATA SYNTHESIS: The primary literature provided information for the use of vitamins, minerals, and supplements, which are popular with older women with chronic disease states. The results included current guidelines that have been established to assist in maintaining good health and to prevent disease in a specific population, those 51 years of age or older. CONCLUSION: When dietary intake is inadequate, a combination of a vitamin preparation, calcium, and an omega-3 preparation can help maintain good health in older women with cardiovascular disease.
