Glaucoma drainage devices create alternate aqueous pathways by channeling aqueous from the anterior chamber through a long tube to an equatorial plate that promotes bleb formation. Glaucoma drainage devices are being used more frequently in the treatment of glaucoma that does not respond to medications or trabeculectomy operations. In certain conditions, such as neovascular glaucoma, iridio-corneal syndrome, penetrating keratoplasty with glaucoma, glaucoma following retinal detachment surgery, and so on, it is becoming the primary operation. This review provides a systematic review of the literature and outlines the current controversies involving different glaucoma drainage devices and their design, overall surgical success, and complications following glaucoma drainage device insertion.
