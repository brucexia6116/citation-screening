Background, Vasoactive and neuroprotective drugs are used to treat stroke in some countries., Objectives, The objective of this review was to assess the effect of vinpocetine in acute ischaemic stroke., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (last searched: August 1999) and Medline. We contacted researchers in the field and drug companies., Selection criteria, Unconfounded randomised trials of vinpocetine compared with placebo, or any other reference treatment, in people with acute stroke. Trials were included if treatment started no later than 14 days after stroke onset., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria. One reviewer extracted the data that was then checked by the second reviewer. Trial quality was assessed., Main results, One trial involving 40 patients was included. Data for 33 patients were reported. No deaths occurred in the trial and no significant difference in dependency was shown between the treatment and placebo groups. No adverse effects were reported., Authors' conclusions, There is not enough evidence to evaluate the effect of vinpocetine on survival or dependency of patients with acute stroke
