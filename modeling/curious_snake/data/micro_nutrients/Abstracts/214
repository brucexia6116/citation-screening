Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital malformation of gastrointestinal tract. It can cause complications in the form of ulceration, haemorrhage, intussusception, intestinal obstruction, perforation and, very rarely, vesicodiverticular fistulae and tumours. These complications, especially bleeding, are more common in the paediatric age group than in adults; however it is not uncommon to miss the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum in adults. Here, we reviewed the literature regarding the complications of this forgotten clinical entity in adults with potential diagnostic difficulties and management strategies. [References: 34]
