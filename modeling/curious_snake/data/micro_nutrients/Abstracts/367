Although elderly patients represent a rapidly growing population often requiring multiple drug treatment, the evidence of effectiveness is limited for many interventions and therapies in this age group. Only during the last 30 years has a requirement to incorporate evidence into the treatment of older subjects become part of the pre- and postmarketing regulatory process in Europe and the United States. Recently, elderly patients have been shown to benefit comparably from several treatments. These studies have supported the validity of an increasingly interventional approach to disorders common in late life. However, an important issue is the applicability of the growing body of clinical trials to 'real life' patients. This is particularly true in very old (i.e. >80 years) patients and those with significant comorbidities. We review the current evidence and controversies related to the effectiveness and safety of several therapeutic strategies in cardiovascular disease (i.e. statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-adrenoceptor blockers, and thrombolytic agents) and bone health (i.e. vitamin D and bisphosphonates).
