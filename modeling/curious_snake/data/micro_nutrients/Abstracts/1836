PURPOSE: To assess how commonly hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and other measures are prescribed for the treatment of osteopenia in children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN). METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed and completed by allopathic and osteopathic physician members of the Society for Adolescent Medicine at its 1998 annual meeting. The questionnaire was also mailed and E-mailed between March 1998 and February 1999. Descriptive statistics included percentages and measures of central tendency. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 394 of the 1029 physicians surveyed (38.3%). Of the 268 respondents who treated patients with AN under the age of 18 years, 77.6% prescribed HRT. The decision to prescribe HRT was influenced by patient's age but not by bone mineral status. Among those who prescribed HRT, additional therapies included increased caloric intake (89.4%), weight gain (82.2%), increased calcium intake (84.1%), a change in exercise patterns (59.1%), and vitamin D supplementation (37.0%). Only 59 (22.0%) did not use HRT as a treatment modality. One-third of nonprescribers cited the lack of evidence of efficacy of HRT in preventing osteopenia. More recent medical graduates were less likely to prescribe HRT. CONCLUSIONS: This survey suggests that practitioners caring for adolescent females with AN commonly prescribe HRT for the treatment of osteopenia despite the paucity of evidence demonstrating that it effectively prevents or reverses bone loss associated with this disorder
