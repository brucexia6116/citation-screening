Zinc acexamate (ZAC) is a new drug for the treatment of peptic ulcer. The present study was performed in order to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ZAC in peptic ulcer, using a meta-analysis of all randomized clinical trials performed with this drug. Eighteen studies were reviewed, but only 13 were considered in the final analysis. The total number of patients was 757. Control groups included placebo or H2 receptor antagonist drugs. Healing rate, assessed by endoscopy, was selected as the criterion for evaluating drug efficacy. The meta-analysis was performed using a modified version of the Mantel-Haenszel method. ZAC proved to be better than placebo in the treatment of peptic ulcer (pooled odds ratio: POR = 5.55; 95% confidence interval: 95% CI = 2.20-14.04) and not different from H2 receptor antagonist drugs when compared in patients with gastric (POR = 1.14; 95% CI = 0.47-2.72), duodenal (POR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.13-7.33) or both ulcer types (POR = 1.10; 95% CI = 0.74-1.64). The present results show that ZAC is an effective drug for the treatment of peptic ulcer
