Chronically transfused patients develop iron overload that leads to organ damage and ultimately to death. The introduction of the iron-chelating agent, desferrioxamine mesylate, dramatically improved the life expectancy of these patients. However, the very demanding nature of this treatment (subcutaneous continuous infusion via a battery-operated portable pump) has been the motivation for attempts to develop alternative forms of treatment that would facilitate the patients' compliance. In this review, we describe the most important advances in iron-chelating therapy. In particular, we analyze a new method of administering desferrioxamine mesylate (twice daily subcutaneous bolus injections) and a novel, orally active iron chelator (ICL670A). We also present a meta-analysis of the largest trials on the oral iron chelator deferiprone and the results of combined therapy (deferiprone and desferrioxamine). [References: 41]
