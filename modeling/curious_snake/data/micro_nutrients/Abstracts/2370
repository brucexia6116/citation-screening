BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis is now widely used in order to increase the power of individual clinical studies. Important far-reaching conclusions have been derived by pooling the results of studies which in isolation would not be large enough to reach definitive conclusions. While the statistical power is thereby amplified, so is the potential for error. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential and the pitfalls of meta-analysis as a guide to clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions derived from meta-analysis may be influenced by unrecognized selection bias and heterogeneity of studies included. Publication of the results may be in a form which does not lend itself readily to critical analysis and misleading results may therefore be accepted. [References: 24]
