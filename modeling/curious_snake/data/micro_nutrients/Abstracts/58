INTRODUCTION: Anal fissure is a common and distressing problem the true incidence of which is probably higher than recorded. There is a progressive understanding of the etiopathogenesis of this entity and the changing trend in its management approach. This is a systematic review of available published literature looking at current management options in anal fissures. METHODS: A MEDLINE-based search of the relevant literature from 1970 to 2004 was performed on the current concepts in etiopathogenesis and management of anal fissure. RESULTS: The current opinion is a drift toward conservative measures as the first- and second-line approaches rather than surgery for treatment of anal fissure. Simple and readily available measures with less complication, good patient compliance, and satisfaction requiring no hospitalization should first be considered. CONCLUSIONS: Most anal fissures heal with medical therapy, but their limitations include side effects, poor compliance, and recurrence of the fissure. A cautious surgical approach is required to treat those who do not respond to medical therapy. [References: 147]
