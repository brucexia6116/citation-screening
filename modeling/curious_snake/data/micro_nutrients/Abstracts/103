PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Poor vitamin K nutrition has recently been linked to several chronic diseases associated with abnormal calcification, which affect many elderly. To understand the impact of vitamin K nutrition on healthy aging it is necessary to assess both the determinants and the adequacy of vitamin K nutritional status of the elderly. RECENT FINDINGS: Overall, elderly persons consume more vitamin K than young adults. However, a subgroup of the elderly population does not meet the current recommended dietary intakes for this nutrient. The first meta-analysis evaluating the data on the role of vitamin K and bone health concluded that increased intakes of vitamin K are warranted to reduce bone loss and fracture risk among the elderly. Recent studies suggest that nondietary determinants of vitamin K status need to be factored into any discussion on the adequacy of nutritional status of the elderly. One promising area of research is the interrelationship between estrogen and vitamin K. SUMMARY: Evidence is emerging to support recommendations to increase intakes of vitamin K among the elderly to reduce bone loss and fracture risk. Much more research is required, however, to identify nondietary determinants of vitamin K status, and their impact on the elderly. [References: 20]
