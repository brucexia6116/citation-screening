Chronic idiopathic singultus (hiccup) is a debilitating condition affecting mostly elderly males. While in the past, pharmacologic singultus treatment was mostly "trial and error," more recently, treatment has become both more evidence based and pathophysiology guided. A combination of an acidity-reducing drug (H(2)-receptor blocker or proton pump inhibitor) with baclofen (gamma-amino-butyric-acid receptor type B agonist) has become the most widely used regimen. Some clinicians replace or supplement baclofen with gabapentin. We present three cases of chronic idiopathic hiccup managed with gabapentin or another alpha-2-delta ligand, pregabalin. This is the first reported use of pregabalin for this indication
