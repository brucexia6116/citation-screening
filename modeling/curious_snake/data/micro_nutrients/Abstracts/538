Several case-control studies performed in populations where the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) is high have examined genetic susceptibility to TB. The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene is a good candidate, because it influences immune response, and associations between TaqI and FokI polymorphisms in the VDR gene and pulmonary TB risk have been found. Furthermore, if a relationship between these polymorphisms and TB risk is confirmed this will be important evidence pointing to vitamin D as a potential preventive agent for TB. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis, and found that results were inconclusive and studies were underpowered
