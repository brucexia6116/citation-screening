A systematic review of the literature on capillary electrophoresis applied to short chain organic acid analysis in body fluids has been conducted with special interest on those acids related to inborn errors of metabolism. The technique is briefly described, as well as the choice of the main analytical parameters: sample pre-treatment, polarity, capillary type, background electrolyte, and detection. The applications described in the literature are listed and the main features of the technique are discussed. [References: 50]
