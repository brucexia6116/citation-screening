Crystal-induced inflammation pathogenesis is undergoing a transition with respect to monosodium urate, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate, and even basic calcium phosphate crystals. It is now recognized that innate immunity could be involved in the earlier pathogenic events and that the inflammasome, along with other signaling pathways, is activated and results in interleukin-1 processing and secretion, ultimately activating cells as a paracrine or autocrine cytokine. Management of acute and chronic monosodium urate crystal-induced inflammation, namely gout, has been critically reviewed by a dedicated European working group, and on the behalf of the European League against Rheumatism, 12 evidence-based recommendations have been reported. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate chronic inflammation could benefit from colchicine and from methotrexate as an anti-inflammatory agent. [References: 38]
