This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, The objective of the review is to determine the effect of the level and duration of incubator humidity used in the first few days or weeks of life on survival and morbidity of preterm infants., (a) Low versus moderate to high level of humidity, (b) Short versus moderate to long duration of humidity, (a) No humidity versus low level of humidity, (b)No humidity versus moderate level of humidity, (c) No humidity versus high level of humidity, (d) Low level of humidity versus moderate level of humidity, (e) Low level of humidity versus high level of humidity, (f) Moderate level of humidity versus high level of humidity, (g) Short duration versus moderate duration of humidity, (h) Short duration versus long duration of humidity, (i) Moderate duration versus long duration of humidity, :, No humidity, low level of humidity < 65%, moderate level of humidity 65%-79%, high humidity >= 80%, :, Short 0-7 days, moderate 8-21 days, long > 21 days, (a) For gestational age, 23-26 weeks; 27-32 weeks; 33-37 weeks, (b) For birthweight, < 1000 g; 1000 g- 2000 g; > 2000 g
