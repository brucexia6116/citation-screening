This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, 1. To examine the existing clinical evidence on the efficacy of prophylactic anticoagulation with direct thrombin inhibitors versus vitamin K antagonists in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients who have undergone total hip or knee replacement, or hip repair., 2. To examine the existing clinical evidence on the efficacy of prophylactic anticoagulation with direct thrombin inhibitors versus low molecular weight heparins, in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients who have undergone total hip or knee replacement, or hip repair., 3. To evaluate the existing clinical evidence on the risks including any adverse event (serious or not) of bleeding, skin necrosis, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or hepatopathy associated with the analyzed therapies, in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients who have undergone total hip or knee replacement, or hip repair., The following hypotheses will be evaluated:, 1. Prophylactic anticoagulation with direct thrombin inhibitors is as effective as prophylactic anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists at reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients who have undergone total hip or knee replacement, or hip repair., 2. Prophylactic anticoagulation with direct thrombin inhibitors is as effective as prophylactic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparins at reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients who have undergone total hip or knee replacement, or hip repair., 3. Prophylactic anticoagulation with direct thrombin inhibitors causes less serious adverse effects as prophylactic anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists in patients who have undergone total hip or knee replacement, or hip repair., 4. Prophylactic anticoagulation with direct thrombin inhibitors causes less serious adverse effects as prophylactic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparins in patients who have undergone total hip or knee replacement, or hip repair
