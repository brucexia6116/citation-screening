OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the extent to which medical aid schemes are funding evidence-based dental care, specifically assessing claims patterns for professionally applied topical fluoride and fissure sealant treatments to the beneficiaries of a large South African medical aid scheme. The rising costs of dental care provide the impetus to review spending patterns to assess whether resources are being utilised optimally. The emergence of evidence-based dentistry offers an important tool in this regard. METHODOLOGY: The 2005 membership and claims data of a large South African medical scheme were analysed for the period 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005. The claim patterns for two dental caries preventive interventions with different levels of evidence were assessed and compared for two age groups: under 20 years of age and 20 and above. RESULTS: About 30% received a topical fluoride application, equally provided to both age categories. Less than 3% of all who visited the dentists received at least one sealant. Of those under 20 years of age, only 10% received this proven preventive intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need to substantially increase the provision of fissure sealants to children with erupting first (5-7 year olds) and second (11-13 year olds) permanent molar teeth and decrease the provision of professionally applied fluoride applications to those outside of specifically identified caries-risk groups. This study further illustrates the potential of applying evidence-based dentistry research findings to assessing the appropriateness of claim patterns as well as the funding thereof
