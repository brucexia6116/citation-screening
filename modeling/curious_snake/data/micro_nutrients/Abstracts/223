Unlike heart failure with a low ejection fraction, there is no evidence-based treatment for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction which improves clinical outcomes. Indeed, the only evidence for any treatment effect comes from small studies with verapamil where this drug increased exercise capacity and reduced a heart failure score. Large trials are presently underway which are examining the effect of treatment with an ACE inhibitor, ARB and aldosterone antagonist in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction.
