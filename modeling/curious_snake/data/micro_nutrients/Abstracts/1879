The experimental evidence that forms the basis for setting recommended intake levels of vitamin C for humans is currently undergoing review. A recent study suggests that a vitamin C intake of 100 mg-200 mg/day is needed, which is two to threefold greater than the current Recommended Dietary Allowance. This study also proposes that individuals consume no more than 1 gram of vitamin C per day. [References: 9]
