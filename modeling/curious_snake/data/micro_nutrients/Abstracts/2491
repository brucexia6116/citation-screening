Indirect evidence, based on injection of thyroxine (T4) into the amniotic cavity of humans, and maternal thyroidectomy in the rat, suggests that fetal membranes might be capable of converting T4 to 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) by virtue of inner ring iodothyronine deiodinase activity. The present study was undertaken to provide direct evidence that human fetal membranes contain inner ring iodothyronine deiodinase activity directed toward T4 and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3). Homogenates of human fetal membranes were incubated with 125I-labeled T4, rT3, and T3, and with stable T4. Conversion of 125[I]-T4 to 125[I]-rT3 was noted in chorion and amnion. 125I-T3 was converted to 125[I]-3,3'-diiodothyronine (T2) in chorion and amnion. 125[I]-rT3 was stable in fetal membranes under the incubation conditions employed. Time-, temperature-, pH-, and protein content-dependent conversion of stable T4 to rT3 was found in fetal membranes. Iodothyronine metabolism did not occur in the absence of dithiothreitol. These studies indicate that human fetal membranes contain an inner ring deiodinase enzyme. Because of its intimate contact with the amniotic cavity, this enzyme may generate a portion of the rT3 found in amniotic fluid
