BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease management involves symptomatic drug treatments passed by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. Disease modification is now the goal. AIMS: To review current and developmental drugs for Alzheimer's disease, their usage, and the clinical context of known facts and proposed specific models. METHOD: A brief evidence-based review was made, using literature where available, or evidence from consensus groups where it was absent. RESULTS: There is good evidence to support the use of cholinesterase inhibitors, and perhaps vitamin E. Oestrogen and anti-inflammatory agents show possibility, but there is not enough evidence to support routine use. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic treatments exist for Alzheimer's disease. Observational studies and increasing knowledge of brain biology are leading towards further treatment options. Old age psychiatrists have valuable treatments they now have to learn to use.
