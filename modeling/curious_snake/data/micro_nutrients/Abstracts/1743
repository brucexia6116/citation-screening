High triglyceride levels are associated with several risk factors that substantially increase the risk of CAD. The metabolic syndrome is a constellation of signs and symptoms (e.g., postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, low LDL cholesterol levels, insulin resistance) that has been linked to a high incidence of heart disease. Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia begins with an aggressive lifestyle modification program. Dietary restriction of alcohol and carbohydrates can significantly lower triglyceride levels in many patients. Pharmacotherapy should be considered for patients at high risk of cardiac disease.
