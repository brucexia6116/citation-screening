Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a common consequence of hypertension, and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The presence and severity of LVH is best determined by echocardiography and expressed as left ventricular mass index or left ventricular wall thickness. Pathological LVH, in response to pressure or volume load on the heart, is characterised by myocyte hypertrophy and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of nonmyocyte cells within the myocardium. Angiotensin II and aldosterone are promoters of increased fibroblast activity and a significant increase in collagen fibres in the myocardium. Early diagnosis and treatment of hypertension has significantly decreased the incidence of LVH and subsequent heart failure in many countries, but the choice of antihypertensive therapy alters the rate of reversal of LVH and the subsequent development of heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers produce the most rapid reversal of hypertrophy. Meta-analysis of these many small trials suggests an advantage of ACE inhibitors over other groups of antihypertensive agents. [References: 28]
