OBJECTIVE: To assess the nutritional advantage of fortified human milk in the small for gestational age neonate. METHODS: Term asymmetric small for gestational age babies were randomly assigned to either the study group or the control group. The babies in the study group received fortified EBM, (more proteins, calories, vitamins and minerals) whereas babies in the control group received EBM only. Babies were followed up weekly for a period of 28 +/- 2 days for physical growth (weight, length and OFC). Biochemical markers of nutritional status (Blood urea, serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, serum electrolytes and serum protein) were done initially and then on Day 28 +/- 2. RESULTS: The weight gain in the study group (38.77 +/- 7.43 g/day) was significantly better than in the control group (28.71 +/- 3.18 g/day). The length and OFC gain in the study group (1.14 +/- 0.33 cm/week and 0.62 +/- 0.07 cms/week, respectively) were significantly better than in the control group (0.87 +/- 0.17 cm/week and 0.49 +/- 0.07 cm/week respectively). The biochemical markers of nutrition, however, were not significantly different in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Fortified breast milk results in improved physical growth in the term asymmetric small for gestational age neonate
