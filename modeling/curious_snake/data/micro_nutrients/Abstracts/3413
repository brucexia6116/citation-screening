The objectives are as follows:, In preterm or low birth weight infants following hospital discharge, does feeding with multicomponent fortified human breast milk versus unfortified breast milk improve growth and development?, If the data are available, we will undertake sub-group analyses of:, 1. infants of very low birth weight (less than 1.5 kilograms) or who are very preterm at birth (less than 32 weeks), 2. infants who remain small for gestational age (less than tenth percentile for the index population's distribution of weight) at hospital discharge, 3. infants with chronic lung disease requiring home supplemental oxygen therapy, 4. infants who receive donated expressed breast milk
