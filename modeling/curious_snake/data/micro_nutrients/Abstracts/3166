Background, Preterm and low birth weight infants are often growth-restricted at hospital discharge. Feeding infants post-hospital discharge with calorie and protein-enriched formula milk might facilitate "catch-up" growth and improve development., Objectives, To review the evidence from randomised controlled trials that feeding following hospital discharge with calorie and protein-enriched formula compared with standard term formula improves growth and development for preterm or low birth weight infants., Search strategy, We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 - December 2004), EMBASE (1980 - December 2004), CINAHL (1982 - December 2004), conference proceedings, and previous reviews., Selection criteria, Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the effect of feeding preterm or low birth weight infants post-hospital discharge with calorie and protein-enriched formula compared with standard term formula., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two authors, and synthesis of data using weighted mean difference and a fixed effects model for meta-analysis., Main results, We found six trials that were eligible for inclusion. These recruited a total of 424 infants and were generally of good methodological quality. These trials found little evidence that feeding with calorie and protein-enriched formula milk affected growth and development. Because of differences in the way individual trials measured and presented outcomes, data synthesis was limited. Meta-analysis of data from two trials found a statistically significant effect on crown-heel length at 18 months post-term (weighted mean difference 9.7 millimetres (95% confidence interval 3.2 to 16.2)), but not on weight or head circumference. Meta-analysis of data from the two trials that assessed neurodevelopment at 18 months post-term did not reveal a statistically significant difference in either Bayley Mental Development Index (weighted mean difference 0.23 (95% confidence interval -2.99 to 3.45)) or Psychomotor Development Index (weighted mean difference 0.56 (95% confidence interval -1.95 to 3.07)). There are not yet any data on growth or development through later childhood., Authors' conclusions, The limited available data do not provide strong evidence that feeding preterm or low birth weight infants following hospital discharge with calorie and protein-enriched formula compared with standard term formula affects growth rates or development up to 18 months post-term
