Heart failure with preserved systolic function is common in patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure and is associated with postdischarge morbidity and costs similar to patients with heart failure and systolic dysfunction. It is common in the older people, and hypertension and cardiac ischemia are often etiological factors. Nurses must be able to recognize left ventricular diastolic abnormalities and understand treatment priorities and treatment options on the basis of structural cardiovascular disease; etiology and risk factors; and signs, symptoms, and hemodynamic parameters. Currently, clinical treatments are on the basis of individual randomized clinical trials; however, there are general principles that should be followed during hospitalization and as part of general practice. As in the treatment of systolic heart failure, nurses have active roles in ensuring accurate assessment; optimal care planning; implementation of clinical, psychosocial; and education interventions; and timely and accurate evaluation so that patients have the best chance for successful hospital and postdischarge outcomes
