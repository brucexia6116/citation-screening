OBJECTIVE: A review of the English language literature was performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of morphine sulfate-augmented hepatobiliary imaging for acute cholecystitis. Twenty publications, involving 914 patients, were reviewed from journals published between 1984 and 1999. The analysis of these patients has resulted in the largest combined review study to date. The sensitivity and specificity of morphine-augmented hepatobiliary imaging were calculated to be 96.1% and 88.6%, respectively. After reading this paper, the nuclear medicine technologist should be able to: (a) discuss the clinical use of morphine augmentation during hepatobiliary imaging; and (b) state the sensitivity and specificity of morphine sulfate-augmented hepatobiliary imaging
