Phosphate enemas are commonly used by community nurses in the treatment of constipation. This article reports on a literature review of evidence relating to their use. No evidence was found to support the use of these enemas conclusively, although a number of articles reported risks, contraindications, and complications. Phosphate enemas should therefore be used with caution and nurses should be aware of the contraindications associated with their use. [References: 22]
