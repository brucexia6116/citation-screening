Insulin resistance has been proposed to be the underlying disorder of the so-called metabolic or insulin resistance syndrome, which represents the clustering in the same individual of several cardiovascular risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. As far as the connection of insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia with hypertension is concerned, a number of mechanisms possibly linking these disturbances have been described, such as activation of sympathetic nervous system, enhancement of renal sodium reabsorption, or impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) constitute a class of oral antihyperglycaemic agents that act by decreasing insulin resistance, and apart from their action on glycaemic control, they have been also reported to exert beneficial effects on other parameters of the metabolic syndrome. In particular, during recent years a considerable number of animal and human studies have shown that the use of TZDs was associated with usually small but significant reductions of blood pressure (BP) levels. Since a possible beneficial action of these compounds on BP could be of particular value for patients with the metabolic syndrome, this review aimed to summarize and evaluate the literature data in the field, derived either from studies that just examined BP levels among other parameters or from studies that were specifically designed to determine the effect of a TZD on BP.
