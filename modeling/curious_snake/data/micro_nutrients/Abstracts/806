Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Vitamin E as an anti-oxidant vitamin, was suggested to have a role in the prevention of CVD. We did a meta-analysis, using the Cochrane Group Methodology, of all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the role of vitamin E in the prevention of CVD. Nine studies met inclusion criteria, including 80,645 participants. Vitamin E supplementation was not associated with a reduction in total mortality or total CVD mortality, but it was associated with a small statistically significant reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease. Prophylactic use of vitamin E in doses ranging between 50-800 IU was not associated with any increase in the incidence of serious side effects
