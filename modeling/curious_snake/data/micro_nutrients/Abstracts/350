OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of leukotriene C4 synthase A-444C polymorphism in allergic rhinitis patients. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective, randomized, case-controlled study. Blood samples were obtained from 85 patients with allergic rhinitis and 95 healthy individuals. After the extraction of DNA from the blood samples, the leukotriene C4 synthase A-444C polymorphism was studied by a real-time polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: The AC and CC genotype frequencies were statistically higher in the study group (P = 0.048 and P = 0.037, respectively). In addition, the AC polymorphism carried an increased risk of developing allergic rhinitis (odds ratio = 2.18, 95% confidence interval, 1.173-4.053, P = 0.014). CONCLUSION: The C allele of the leukotriene C4 synthase gene increases the risk of developing allergic rhinitis. SIGNIFICANCE: The leukotriene C4 synthase A-444C gene polymorphism is important in susceptibility to allergic rhinitis and this is the first study of this gene polymorphism in allergic rhinitis.
