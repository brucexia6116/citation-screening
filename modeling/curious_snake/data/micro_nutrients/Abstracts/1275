OBJECTIVE: Using an evidence-based approach, a Vermont Oxford Network focus group whose goal was to reduce brain injury developed and implemented a number of potentially better practices. Each center approached implementation of the practices differently. Reducing the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia are important for improving long-term outcomes for low birth weight infants. METHODS: Implementation approaches for some but not all of the practices at the various centers are discussed. The practices reviewed include optimal peripartum management, such as resuscitation, avoidance of hypothermia, optimal surfactant delivery, early neonatal management by the most experienced providers, and measures to minimize pain and stress. Additional practices include maintenance of neutral head positioning, fluid volume therapy for hypotension, indomethacin prophylaxis, ventilator management, avoidance of routine suctioning, and limiting the use of sodium bicarbonate and postnatal dexamethasone. RESULTS: Approaches to implementation were center specific, and results vary. Although some practices were easier to implement than others, communication, education, and leadership were critical to the process. CONCLUSIONS: The quality improvement multidisciplinary approach is a useful tool for finding ways to reduce the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia
