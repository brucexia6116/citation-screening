A short cut review was carried out to establish whether intubation is always required in patients presenting with a decreased conscious level after gamma-hydroxybutyrate ingestion. Altogether 95 papers were found using the reported search, of which two presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. A clinical bottom line is stated.
