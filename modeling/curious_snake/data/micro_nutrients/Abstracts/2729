Background, Between 4% and 25% of school age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities. For the majority of such children no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Although most children are likely managed by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of interventions has been recommended., Objectives, To determine the effectiveness of medication for recurrent abdominal pain in school-age children., Search strategy, The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycLIT, LILACS and JICST were searched using a strategy combining (Recurrent OR synonyms) AND (Abdomen OR synonyms) AND (Pain OR synonyms). Where appropriate search filters were employed. In addition, researchers working in this area were asked to identify relevant studies., Selection criteria, Any study in which the majority of participants were school age children fulfilling standard criteria for RAP, and who were allocated by random or quasi-random methods to any drug treatment compared with a placebo or no treatment., Data collection and analysis, References identified by the searches were screened against the inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers., Main results, Only one trial met the inclusion criteria. This cross-over trial in 14 children who met suggested criteria for "abdominal migraine" compared pizotifen and placebo, each given for one month with no washout period. Participants reported a mean of 8.21 (95% CI 2.93, 13.48) fewer days of pain while taking the active drug. They also reported that the mean difference on an "Index of Severity" was -16.21 (95% CI -26.51, -5.90) and on an "Index of Misery" was -56.07 (95% CI -94.07, -18.07)., Authors' conclusions, There is little evidence to suggest that recommended drugs are effective in the management of RAP. At present there seems little justification for the use of these drugs other than in clinical trials. There is an urgent need for trials of all suggested pharmacologic interventions in children with RAP
