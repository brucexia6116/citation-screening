Numerous trials and meta-analyses have been conducted over the last five years to identify an ideal anti-hypertensive drug. These reports, and the JNC 7 and European hypertension guidelines, have generated some controversy and confusion. A review of the comparative anti-hypertensive drug trials shows that the differences between drugs are minor and not consistently demonstrated by different studies. However, much data have now accumulated on the safety and value of diuretics, beta blockers, calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in reducing blood pressure and preventing clinical disease. The importance of tight blood pressure control in reducing adverse events has been clearly shown, and clinicians should concentrate on achieving target blood pressure levels, which often requires a combination of anti-hypertensive drugs. The choice of anti-hypertensive drug should be guided by the presence of concomitant clinical disease, as evidence has accumulated on the special efficacy of certain drugs in reducing damage to particular organ systems. In the absence of any associated clinical disease, it is good to initiate anti-hypertensive therapy with diuretics, provided the metabolic parameters are regularly reviewed. [References: 43]
