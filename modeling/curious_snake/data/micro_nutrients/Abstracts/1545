Perhexiline was introduced about 30 years ago and rapidly gained a reputation for efficacy in the management of angina pectoris. However, hepatic and neurological adverse effects associated with perhexiline administration led to a marked decline in its use. The drug was originally classified as a coronary vasodilator, and later as a calcium channel antagonist, but recent data suggests that it acts as a cardiac metabolic agent, through inhibition of the enzyme, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1). Given the drug's unique anti-ischemic action and favorable hemodynamic profile, together with an improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of the drug and the clear clinical need for additional therapies in refractory patients, perhexiline is currently being re-appraised as a potentially useful agent in the management of severe myocardial ischemia. Perhexiline is being considered for registration or re-registration in a number of countries and is being evaluated in a large-scale clinical trial in elderly patients with aortic stenosis and myocardial ischemia. This systematic review examines the evidence from available published literature in relation to the efficacy and tolerability of perhexiline in the treatment of cardiac disease. While there is a lack of well designed controlled trials using objective end-points to determine efficacy (almost all trials used a crossover design, included small numbers of patients and had limited statistical analysis of results), there is consistency in the data available that perhexiline is considerably more effective than placebo when used as monotherapy. Furthermore, it affords additional symptom relief in those already receiving maximal conventional anti-anginal therapy. However, there is a paucity of trials demonstrating the efficacy of low dosages of perhexiline (100 to 200 mg/day) in patients with refractory angina pectoris. Available evidence also suggests that the incidence of adverse events can be minimised, and the efficacy maintained, by keeping plasma perhexiline concentrations within a therapeutic range (150 to 600 micro g/L) [References: 79]
