This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, The objectives are:, (1) To determine the efficacy of alendronate therapy for the prevention of tooth loss in postmenopausal women., (2) To investigate whether alendronate therapy can prevent the reduction in the density of alveolar bone., (3) To evaluate whether alendronate therapy can prevent the reduction in the height of alveolar bone in postmenopausal women., (4) To test the beneficial and harmful effects of alendronate when compared to placebo., The following null hypotheses will be tested., (1) There is no difference between the proportion/number of teeth lost in women receiving alendronate therapy compared with a group receiving no intervention/placebo against the alternative hypothesis of a difference., (2) There is no difference between the density of alveolar bone in women receiving alendronate therapy compared with a group receiving no intervention/placebo., (3) There is no difference between the height alveolar bone in women receiving alendronate therapy compared with a group receiving no intervention/placebo
