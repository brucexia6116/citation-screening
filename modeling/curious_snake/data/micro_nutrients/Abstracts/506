BACKGROUND: Secondary prevention therapies, such as angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and statins, are known to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and the prescribing of secondary preventive therapies in the period 1990-2002. METHODS: The General Medical Services prescription database was used to identify the study cohort, those with CHD, in each year 1990-2002. CHD was defined in two ways: prescription of any nitrate, and co-prescription of nitrate and aspirin. In addition, co-prescription of secondary preventive agents including statins, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers were examined. RESULTS: We found a significant increasing prevalence of CHD from 1990 to 2002 in both men and women. There was a significant increase (p < 0.0001) in the prescribing rate for beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and for statins, buta significant decrease (p < 0.0001) for calcium channel blockers. CONCLUSION: These trends reflect the growing evidence base on the effectiveness of secondary preventive therapies, and the implementation of the National Cardiovascular Health Strategy
