Evidence based on animal studies suggests that cholecystokinin (CCK) is involved in the induction and development of acute experimental pancreatitis. However, the results obtained with CCK or CCKA receptor antagonists in different species (rats, mice) and different models of acute pancreatitis (cerulein pancreatitis, hemorrhagic pancreatitis induced by choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet, arginine-induced pancreatitis, sodium taurocholate-induced pancreatitis) produced variable results. The route of administration, the specificity and potency of compounds and the design of the study are predictive for the outcome. Based on the available information, CCK appears to play a contributory role in the development of acute experimental pancreatitis in mice and rats. No conclusions can be drawn from these results with respect to the human disease
