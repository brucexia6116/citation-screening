Goals of hemorrhage management involve promoting coagulation and reducing fibrinolysis to enhance clot formation and stability, and minimizing hemorrhagic expansion to reduce the likelihood of adverse outcomes. The optimal hemostatic regimen to obtain these goals will differ according to the clinical scenario. Two hypothetical cases of patients with hemorrhage are presented that are typical of those encountered by clinical pharmacists who practice in centers that treat trauma or surgical patients or patients in need of emergency or critical care because of serious bleeding. To maximize therapy, the clinician must be aware of how best to clinically apply hemostatic agents, their comparative benefits and disadvantages, and the optimal methods for monitoring their effectiveness and toxicities
