The article reviews and critically evaluates the available evidence to determine whether the current recommendations for the management of infants born through meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) should be maintained. Authors provide evidence-based recommendations regarding the benefits of amnioinfusion prior to delivery, oral suctioning of the newborn prior to delivery of the shoulder, and the practice of routine endotracheal suctioning of the newborn born through MSAF in preventing meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Authors also discuss the gaps in knowledge in all the above interventions to prevent MAS. [References: 57]
