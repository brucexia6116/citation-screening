A short cut review was carried out to establish whether nimodipine is better than placebo at reducing mortality and neurological sequelae in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Altogether 465 papers were found using the reported search, of which one presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of this best paper are tabulated. A clinical bottom line is stated.
