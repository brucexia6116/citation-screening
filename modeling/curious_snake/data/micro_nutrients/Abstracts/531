BACKGROUND: Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV is the dominant mode of acquisition of HIV infection for children, currently resulting in more than 2000 new paediatric HIV infections each day worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antenatal and intrapartum vitamin A supplementation on the risk of MTCT of HIV infection and infant and maternal mortality and morbidity, and the tolerability of vitamin A supplementation. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, LILACS, AIDSTRIALS, and AIDSDRUGS, using standardised methodological filters for identifying trials. We also searched reference lists of identified articles, relevant editorials, expert opinions and letters to journal editors, and abstracts or proceedings of relevant conferences; and contacted subject experts, agencies, organisations, academic centres, and pharmaceutical companies. There were no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing vitamin A supplementation with no vitamin A supplementation in known HIV infected pregnant women. Trials had to include an estimate of the effect of vitamin A supplementation on MTCT of HIV and or any other adverse pregnancy outcome to be included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. Effect measures (odds ratio [OR] for binary variables and weighted mean difference [WMD] for continuous variables) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for each study and combined using the fixed effect (Mantel-Haenszel) method, by intention to treat. Heterogeneity between studies was examined by graphical inspection of results followed by a chi-square test of homogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials, which enrolled 3,033 HIV-infected pregnant women, are included in this review. There was no evidence of an effect of vitamin A supplementation on MTCT of HIV infection (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.38). There was evidence of heterogeneity between the three trials with information on MTCT of HIV (I(2) =75.7%, P=0.02). While the trials conducted in South Africa (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.42 at three months) and Malawi (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15 at 24 months) did not find evidence that the effect of Vitamin A supplementation was different from that of placebo, the trial in Tanzania did find evidence that vitamin A supplementation increased the risk of MTCT of HIV (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.04 at 24 months). Vitamin A supplementation significantly improved birth weight (WMD 89.78, 95% CI 84.73 to 94.83), but there was no evidence of an effect of vitamin A supplementation on stillbirths (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.46), preterm births (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11), death by 24 months among live births (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.40), postpartum CD4 levels (WMD -4.00, 95% CI -51.06 to 43.06), and maternal death (OR 0.49, 95%CI 0.04 to 5.40). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Implications for practice: Currently available evidence do not support the use of vitamin A supplementation of HIV-infected pregnant women to reduce MTCT of HIV, though there is an indication that vitamin A supplementation improves birth weight.Implications for research: The awaited publication of data from a large trial involving 4,495 HIV infected pregnant women in Harare (Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies Project), will further clarify the effect of vitamin A supplementation on MTCT of HIV. The current review will be updated as soon as the trial is published. [References: 45]
