OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the prescribing patterns of anti-emetics for pregnant women in Germany. METHOD: A large, nation-wide German statutory sickness fund provided data of reimbursed prescriptions and personal data for all insured women giving birth between June 2000 and May 2001 (n = 41,293). The prescribed drugs were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code. RESULT: About 13.9% (n = 5,746) of all pregnant women received an anti-emetic prescription. Over 98.5% of these women were treated with anti-emetics that are considered safe. But only 27.8% received the recommended anti-histamine meclozine and 2.1% the safest drug pyridoxine. CONCLUSION: As there are no official guidelines for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy in Germany, many different drugs are used, sometimes ignoring effectiveness and even safety. Therefore, evidence-based guidelines for anti-emetic therapy are needed
