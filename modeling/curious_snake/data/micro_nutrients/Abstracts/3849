Accomplishing a successful percutaneous coronary intervention in a patient with a suspected or diagnosed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) requires the selection of an appropriate alternative anticoagulant and a thorough assessment of bleeding and thrombotic risks. In this review, we suggest an evidence-based management algorithm that takes into account the clinical phase of HIT (acute, recent, and remote HIT) and the associated risk when patients present with acute coronary syndrome. The algorithm also integrates preventive measures directed at decreasing the bleeding risk associated with the antithrombotic and invasive therapies used for HIT and percutaneous coronary intervention.
