BACKGROUND: Capsule endoscopy is proving to be superior to push enteroscopy and barium contrast radiography for evaluation of the small bowel. However, its impact on clinical outcome has not been thoroughly investigated. This study assessed changes in therapy based on capsule endoscopy findings and on the impact of such changes on patient outcomes. METHODS: Forty-four consecutive capsule endoscopies in 43 patients were reviewed. Data were collected by systematic review of patient records and included indication, results of prior diagnostic tests, and capsule endoscopy findings. Specific interventions after capsule endoscopy and clinical outcome were noted. RESULTS: The indication for capsule endoscopy was obscure GI bleeding in 40 patients, iron deficiency anemia in one, and right lower quadrant abdominal pain in two patients. Overall diagnostic yield was 42% (18/43 patients). Diagnostic findings included angiodysplasias (n = 13), intestinal ulcers (n = 2), Crohn's disease (n = 2), and mass lesion (n = 1). As a result of the capsule endoscopy findings, a specific intervention was implemented in 12 of 18 patients with positive findings. These included endoscopy with coagulation (n = 5), laparotomy (n = 2), pharmacotherapy (n = 4), and discontinuation of medication (n = 1). At a mean follow-up of 6.7 months, the clinical outcome was considered positive in 7 of 43 patients (16%). CONCLUSIONS: Although it has a high diagnostic yield, capsule endoscopy has a positive influence on clinical outcome in a relatively small proportion of patients. Larger studies are needed that assess the influence of capsule endoscopy on clinical outcomes
