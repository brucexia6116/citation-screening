Scientific evidence continues to accumulate regarding fasting serum triglycerides as an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. In response, the National Cholesterol Education Program has revised the acceptable level of fasting triglycerides from <200 mg/dL to <150 mg/dL. A significant percentage of Americans suffer from hypertriglyceridemia, and considering the expanding numbers of individuals who are physically inactive, overweight, and suffering from the metabolic syndrome, it is expected that these numbers will continue to rise over the next decade. Fortunately, nutraceutical and lifestyle options have been shown to substantially and consistently reduce this risk factor. This review will focus on management options for the hypertriglyceridemic patient with an emphasis on nicotinic acid, pantethine, fish oils (eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids), and modified carbohydrate diets.
