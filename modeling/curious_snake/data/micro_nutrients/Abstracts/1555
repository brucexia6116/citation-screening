OBJECTIVE: To review and analyse criteria for vitamin supplementation and fortification in Spain. DESIGN: Systematic review of scientific literature and simulation analysis of food fortification. METHODS: A simulation analysis using a fortified beverage was performed in a random sample of 2855 children aged 2 to 24 years in Spain. RESULTS: High-risk groups for vitamin supplementation and fortification in Spain are highlighted, and target vitamins considered have been: folic acid, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin D and vitamin B12 (particularly in the elderly). A beverage fortified with vitamins C, A, B1 and B6 may contribute to improving the intake of all of these vitamins with the exception of vitamin A, since the Recommended Nutrient Intake is already covered with current consumption. CONCLUSIONS: A detailed knowledge of nutritional status helps to ensure the rationale and follow up of nutrient supplementation and fortification. [References: 25]
