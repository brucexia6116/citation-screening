OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of ethambutol neuroretinopathy. DESIGN: Case report and meta-analysis of the literature. PARTICIPANTS: A patient with clinical and electrophysiological findings suggestive of ethambutol neuroretinopathy. TESTING: Electroretinogram, electro-oculogram and visual fields. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical and electrophysiological findings. RESULTS: 101 cases were reviewed, retinal findings include retinal pigment epithelial changes, macular edema, flame-shaped hemorrhages. Electroretinogram findings include decreased amplitude and abnormal wave pattern in full field ERG, multifocal or pattern ERG and electro-oculogram findings include abnormal Arden ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical, electrophysiological and in vitro studies support the toxic effect of ethambutol on the retina. Therefore ethambutol ocular toxicity may be a neuroretinopathy. [References: 40]
