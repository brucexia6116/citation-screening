Nine publications are reviewed concerning blood pressure (BP) levels among Amerindian tribes of the Amazon Basin. The lifestyle of these lowland peoples includes most known protective factors against hypertension, and relative isolation from Western society. The latter, however, is rapidly changing. Sampling, data, and analysis problems make current blood pressure data difficult to interpret, and provide a questionable baseline from which to document pressure change during rapid culture change for these groups. Ethnographic and epidemiological perspectives are offered for future blood pressure and health studies among native Amazonians
