This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, The primary objectives of the review are:, 1. To assess the effects on maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of intravenous fluids with or without additional oral intake (fluids and food) administered to women in labour for the treatment of ketosis compared with no intervention defined as no oral intake, ice chips only, or oral intake on demand., 2. To assess the effects on maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of additional oral intake alone (fluids and food) for women in labour in the treatment of ketosis compared with no intervention defined as no oral intake, ice chips only, or oral intake on demand., 3. To assess the effects on maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of different types of intravenous fluids with or without additional oral intake (fluids and food) administered to women in labour for the treatment of ketosis., A secondary objective of the review is to determine whether the effects on the primary outcome measures of spontaneous vaginal delivery; maternal satisfaction with labour care; maternal adverse effects; and neonatal admission to intensive care nursery measures are influenced by different types of oral and intravenous fluids as follows:, (i) intravenous therapy solutions, i.e. glucose solutions, balanced salt solutions (i.e. Hartmanns), normal saline;, (ii) high carbohydrate oral fluids
