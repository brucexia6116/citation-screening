PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The role of hyperglycaemia in the pathogenesis of myocardial damage during cardiac surgery or patients with acute coronary syndromes has been the subject of increasing interest over the past few years. Several further trials and meta-analyses investigating the role of insulin treatment, either aimed at tight control of blood glucose concentration or as part of a regimen including glucose and potassium, have been reported recently and are the subject of this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Good control of blood glucose has been demonstrated to improve outcomes for diabetic patients undergoing cardiac surgery and following acute myocardial infarction. In surgical intensive care patients, tight glucose control improved mortality--a finding that is awaiting confirmation in multicentre studies. The use of glucose-insulin-potassium regimens does not improve outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction who have undergone reperfusion therapy, but may be beneficial during cardiac surgery. SUMMARY: Tight control of blood glucose has been shown to be beneficial in several patient groups. The optimal target glucose concentration and glucose and insulin regimens remain to be confirmed or determined in each clinical situation. [References: 51]
