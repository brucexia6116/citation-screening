The current health care trend is to provide evidence-based recommendations and treatment. Many literature reviews have shown fluoride's effectiveness against caries. The current use of fluoride in the prevention of dental caries is based on community, professional, and individual strategies. Personalized fluoride regimens should include a risk analysis and a review of the patient's current fluoride exposure. The future of fluoride may be found in its slow release and retention in the oral cavity through various modalities. Because of the many uncertainties still associated with fluoride, further research is needed. [References: 140]
