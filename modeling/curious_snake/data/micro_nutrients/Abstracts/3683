We have previously reported that the urine of febrile humans contained large quantities of an inhibitor of IL-1-induced murine thymocyte proliferation that was a glycoprotein between 30 and 40 kD in size. In the present study this factor has been purified to homogeneity using a sequence of eight purification steps (ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, molecular sieve chromatography, hydrophobic affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, fast protein liquid chromatography, and two HPLC steps). SDS-PAGE analysis indicates that the purified material is a 38-kD molecule. Evidence based on a partial amino acid sequence analysis as well as enzyme studies indicates that this inhibitor is a type of human DNase I
