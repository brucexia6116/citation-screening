Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common, but often underdiagnosed, neurological disorder, which is characterised by an imperative urge to move the extremities associated with paraesthesias, worsening of symptoms at rest and in the evening or at night, and, as a consequence, sleep disturbances. RLS affects 1-10% of the population. The aetiology of RLS is unknown, but besides genetic factors the dopaminergic and opioidergic system may play a crucial role and new developments also point to an exciting iron-dopamine connection in the pathophysiology of this burdening disorder. Due to the limited disease-specific knowledge, current treatment strategies are not curative, but nevertheless may produce an effective and lasting relief of symptoms. Although clinically based treatment has focused on levodopa, opioids and benzodiazepines for a long time, evidence-based and clinical guidelines identify dopamine agonists as a first-line treatment for daily restless legs symptoms. These substances are now in the process of registration for this indication. Ropinirole is the first dopamine agonist that has been approved by the FDA in May 2005. In addition, several promising new therapies with nondopamine profiles are under development for RLS. [References: 132]
