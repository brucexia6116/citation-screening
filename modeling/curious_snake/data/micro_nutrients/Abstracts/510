BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis and osteopenia are characterized by reductions in bone mass and may lead to skeletal fragility and fracture. The purpose of this paper is to review studies to determine the relationship between oral bone loss and osteoporosis. In addition, the major modes of therapy for osteoporosis are discussed. METHODS: In this convenience review, papers studying the possible correlation between oral bone loss and osteoporosis in humans, written in the English language since 1983, were reviewed. RESULTS: The methods used to assess oral and systemic bone varied greatly from study to study. Therefore, the results were not amenable to meta-analysis. Thirteen of the 15 studies did show a positive correlation between systemic bone mass and oral bone mass (or bone loss). CONCLUSION: Studies to date indicate a possible correlation between systemic and oral bone loss. [References: 59]
