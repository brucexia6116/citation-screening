A short cut review was carried out to establish whether loop diuretics are useful for critically ill patients with renal failure. A total of 1017 citations were reviewed of which two answered the three part question. The clinical bottom line is that in critically ill patients with acute renal failure, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of loop diuretics reduces mortality, reduces length of ITU/hospital stay, or increases the recovery of renal function.
