AIM: Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) of the lower limbs is a major cause of morbidity and varicose veins affect 20% to 60% of adults in the western world. The treatment of patients with CVI attempts to reduce both clinical symptoms and the development of chronic venous disease. A meta-analysis using data from all clinical trials and studies of Cyclo 3 Fort, a combination of root extract of the Ruscus aculeatus plant (150 mg per capsule), hesperidin methyl chalcone (150 mg) and ascorbic acid (100 mg), was carried out to estimate the overall effect on the symptoms and severity of chronic venous insufficiency. METHODS: The meta-analysis included 20 placebo controlled, randomised, double blind studies and 5 randomised studies against a comparator drug. There were 6 single arm studies of Cyclo 3 Fort alone with no placebo arm. In all studies the response to Cyclo 3 Fort was compared to baseline values. In total there was information from 10,246 subjects. RESULTS: On a 4 point symptom severity scale, where 0 corresponds to no symptoms and 3 to severe symptoms, Cyclo 3 Fort significantly reduces the severity of pain by 0.44 (0.12) points; cramps 0.26 (0.08), heaviness 0.53 (0.11), and paraesthesia 0.29 (0.10) compared to placebo. There is also a significant reduction in venous capacity of 0.70 (0.19) ml/100 ml with Cyclo 3 Fort compared to placebo. We also found reductions in the severity of oedema 0.43 (0.20) points, and decreases in calf and ankle circumference, 0.73 (0.37) cms and 1.17 (0.83) cm, respectively, among patients treated with Cyclo 3 Fort compared to placebo which were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Despite questions surrounding the variability of data quality and sample size of some of the studies, we conclude that in patients with CVI Cyclo 3 Fort significantly reduces the severity of the symptoms compared to placebo. This study is a strong and objective demonstration of the clinical efficacy of Cyclo 3 Fort in treating patients with CVI
