Cost consequences of antihypertensive drug pricing were compared in the United States and Sweden. Because of price differences, US drug acquisition costs to prevent one cardiovascular event were 339%, 127%, and 22% higher using the most prescribed calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and beta blocker, but 65% lower with hydrochlorothiazide. As thiazides are as effective as, but cheaper than, the alternatives, the costs of effective antihypertensive drug treatment may be pronouncedly reduced in both countries. This emphasizes not only the importance of drug pricing but also the cost-increasing influence of commercial marketing. More producer-independent and evidence-based drug information to prescribers is necessary
