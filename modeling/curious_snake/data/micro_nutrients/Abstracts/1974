The target hematocrit to be achieved when treating anemia in hemodialysis patients with erythropoietin is controversial. Current evidence-based recommendations suggest a target hematocrit range of 33% to 36%. Small studies suggest that normalization of hematocrit with erythropoietin may benefit hemodialysis patients in terms of brain function, physical performance, quality of life, and prevention of progressive left ventricular dilatation. However a recent study of the effects of erythropoietin-induced normalization of hematocrit in hemodialysis patients with symptomatic heart disease has shown an increase in both mortality and the rate of vascular access thrombosis. Currently, normalization of hematocrit in patients with symptomatic heart disease is not recommended, nor is it possible to conclude that possible benefits of normalization of hematocrit will outweigh risks in hemodialysis patients without symptomatic heart disease.
