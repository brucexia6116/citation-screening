Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug that stabilizes neural membranes by blocking the activation of voltage-sensitive sodium channels and inhibiting the presynaptic release of glutamate. Full length reports of five open trials and six out of seven randomized controlled trials (plus two abstracts) have demonstrated the efficacy of lamotrigine in the treatment of various forms of neuropathic pain. The present drug profile provides a review of the pharmacologic properties of lamotrigine, the clinical evidence related to its efficacy and safety, and discusses the current and future role of the drug in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
