Treatments for acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) have advanced over the past few decades. Although AMIs are considered medical emergencies, continuing research has provided protocols and guidelines that significantly decrease mortality and reinfarction rates.

This article discusses current recommendations and treatments for post-AMI elderly patients. [References: 22]
