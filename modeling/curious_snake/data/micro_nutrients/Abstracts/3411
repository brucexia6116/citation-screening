This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, The primary objective is to assess the efficacy (measured by changes in respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and croup scores) and safety (frequency of side effects) of nebulised adrenergic agonists with dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone, and of nebulised adrenergic agonists administered alone versus dexamethasone. The study population will be children with moderate to severe croup or laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis. We aim to establish an effective and safe dosage or treatment regime and to specifically review the evidence for the following hypothesis: nebulised adrenergic agents in moderate to severe croup are effective in relieving upper airway obstruction
