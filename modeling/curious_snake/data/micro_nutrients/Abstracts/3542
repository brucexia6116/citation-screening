This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, The following null hypotheses will be tested:, There is no difference in completeness of caries removal between conventional and chemo-mechanical caries removal., There is no difference in pain intensity during conventional and chemo-mechanical caries removal., There is no difference in length of conventional and chemo-mechanical treatment to achieve complete caries removal., There is no difference in tooth viability after conventional and chemo-mechanical caries removal., There is no difference in length of survival of subsequent fillings after conventional and chemo-mechanical caries removal., There is no difference in later symptoms (such as toothache, heat sensitivity etc) after conventional and chemo-mechanical caries removal., There is no difference in the adhesion between dentine and a composite restoration after conventional and chemo-mechanical caries removal
