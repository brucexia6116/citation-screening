This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, 1. To determine the effect of patient isolation measures (single room isolation and cohorting) for infants with candida colonization or infection as an adjunct to routine infection control measures (which include handwashing, wearing gloves and gowns, use of incubators) on the transmission of candida to other infants in the neonatal unit., The following comparisons will be made:, a) Patient isolation measures as an adjunct to routine infection control measures vs. routine infection control measures, b) Single room isolation vs. cohorting for infants used as adjuncts to routine infection control measures, Planned subgroup analyses will be considered if data is available for the following subgroups based on:, a) Single room isolation vs. routine isolation measures, b) Cohorting vs. routine isolation measures, :, Isolation of Candida from the skin or mucous membranes without clinical manifestations., 1) Mucocutaneous candidiasis: clinical manifestation of skin and mucous membranes with isolation of Candida, 2) Systemic or invasive candidiasis: Isolation of Candida in the blood, CSF (meningitis), urine obtained by suprapubic aspirate or by sterile catheterisation (UTI) or from any other sterile site (e.g. pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, intravascular devices, etc)
