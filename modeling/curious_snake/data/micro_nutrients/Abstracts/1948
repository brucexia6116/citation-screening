Over the past 20 to 30 years there have been significant advances in the management of heart failure related to improved understanding of pathophysiology, better methods of assessment, and improved drug treatments. The aims of treatment have broadened, with increased emphasis on earlier intervention. Clinical research activity in this area has been considerable, increasingly allowing an evidence-based approach to management. Most earlier trials of treatment were relatively short-term, small-group studies with various clinical end points, including severity of symptoms, exercise performance, and left ventricular function assessment; however, increasingly a higher standard of evidence has been required, including a provision of reliable, large-scale mortality trial data. This has been further encouraged, if not mandated, by the relatively recent appreciation that some agents may demonstrate dissociation of treatment effects, possibly dose related, with improved short-term outcomes but adverse effects on survival with prolonged treatment. The general principles of management of congestive heart failure encompass patient evaluation and confirmation of the diagnosis, consideration, and correction of underlying remediable causes and precipitating factors, pharmacological treatment, patient education and counseling, and planned follow-up, as summarized in recently published guidelines. This review focuses primarily on the available randomized controlled clinical trial evidence related to the pharmacological treatment of the clinical congestive heart failure syndrome. Other aspects of management, such as patient education, counseling, and planned follow-up, should be regarded as complementary to pharmacological treatment and important to ensure compliance and optimal long-term outcomes.
