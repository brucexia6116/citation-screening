The members of the Management and Therapy Subcommittee assessed current dry eye therapies. Each member wrote a succinct evidence-based review on an assigned aspect of the topic, and the final report was written after review by and with consensus of all subcommittee members and the entire Dry Eye WorkShop membership. In addition to its own review of the literature, the Subcommittee reviewed the Dry Eye Preferred Practice Patterns of the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the International Task Force (ITF) Delphi Panel on Dry Eye. The Subcommittee favored the approach taken by the ITF, whose recommended treatments were based on level of disease severity. the recommendations of the Subcommittee are based on a modification of the ITF severity grading scheme, and suggested treatments were chosen from a menu of therapies for which evidence of therapeutic effect had been presented.
