The aim of this new statement is to provide comprehensive and timely evidence-based recommendations on the screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general population and selected subsets of patients. Recommendations are included for high-risk persons in the general population; patients undergoing open heart surgery including coronary artery bypass surgery; patients with peripheral vascular diseases, abdominal aortic aneurysms, and renal artery stenosis; patients after radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies; patients following carotid endarterectomy, or carotid artery stent placement; patients with retinal ischemic syndromes; patients with syncope, dizziness, vertigo or tinnitus; and patients with a family history of vascular diseases and hyperhomocysteinemia. The recommendations are based on prevalence of disease, anticipated benefit, and concurrent guidelines from other professional organizations in selected populations
