In order to tackle the problems of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of asthma in childhood general practitioners need to be aware of which children in their practices have or might have asthma. In an effort to identify a cohort of asthmatic or potentially asthmatic children a trained audit facilitator studied all the medical records of children aged between one year and 15 years who were registered with 12 Tayside general practices. From a total of 10,685 medical records the frequency of 'key items' sometimes associated with asthma were as follows: one or more episodes of bronchospasm or wheeze 23.7% of children, persistent cough 23.2%, treatment with anti-asthma therapy in the past 20.0%, exercise induced cough or wheeze 5.2% and history of 'wheezy bronchitis' 4.6%. However, in only 896 children (8.4%) had a formal diagnosis of asthma been made. Of all the children, 5.4% had received a prescription for anti-asthma medication within the past three months. Only 1.2% were taking an inhaled corticosteroid and 1.0% sodium cromoglycate, but many more were taking inhaled bronchodilators (3.1%) and oral bronchodilators (1.7%). The findings suggest that a systematic review of medical records by a trained facilitator can identify those children who could benefit from clinical review. Practices who wish to know which of their children have or might have asthma should consider using medical record review to search for key items associated with asthma
