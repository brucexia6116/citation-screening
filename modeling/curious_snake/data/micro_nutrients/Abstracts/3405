This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, Primary objective, To determine the efficacy and safety of nitrates compared to placebo or no intervention in preventing either perioperative myocardial infarction or in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. The perioperative period covers both the intraoperative and postoperative periods., Secondary objectives, (1) To determine the efficacy of nitrates compared to placebo or no intervention in preventing secondary cardiac endpoints (see 'Types of outcome measures') and improving quality of life and long-term survival in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery., (2) To determine, when possible in subgroup analyses, the efficacy of nitrates in preventing perioperative myocardial infarction or all-cause mortality in relation to:, (a) absence or presence of coronary artery disease (as determined by a history of angina thought to be as a result of coronary artery disease, a previous myocardial infarction, or other investigations such as angiography that are positive for the presence of coronary artery disease or previous myocardial infarction);, (b) time period (preoperative, intraoperative or postoperative) of nitrate administration;, (c) type of non-cardiac surgery;, (d) urgency of surgery (elective or emergent); and, (e) type of nitrate used., (3) To determine the effect of concomitant pharmacological agents, such as beta-adrenergic antagonists or alpha-2 agonists, on the estimate of treatment effect of perioperative nitrates
