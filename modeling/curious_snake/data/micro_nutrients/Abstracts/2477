A review of the literature indicates that sucralfate attains a healing rate of 79 percent for duodenal ulcer and 75 percent for gastric ulcer in four and eight weeks, respectively, rates not different from those reported for cimetidine and ranitidine. Meta-analyses show that, whereas cigarette smoking significantly affects duodenal ulcer healing by acid-reducing agents, the healing rates of smokers and non-smokers treated with sucralfate are indistinguishable, suggesting an inherent advantage through the underlying mechanisms of the drug. Pooling reports in the literature indicates that the 12-month relapse curves of duodenal ulcers initially healed with sucralfate and colloidal bismuth subcitrate closely overlap each other and are significantly lower than the curves of the histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists under comparison. A review of the ulcer relapse rates following initial healing in the literature shows that patients receiving acid-reducing agents such as antacids, H2-receptor antagonists, and omeprazole have relapses at similar rates. Use of anticholinergics or non-antisecretory agents including carbenoxolone sodium is associated with a longer remission. Preliminary evidence is available to support the concept that the use of acid-reducing agents results in up-regulation, whereas the use of anticholinergics and non-antisecretory agents is associated with down-regulation of the parietal cells. These changes at the molecular level may help to explain the differences in relapse rates following initial healing with various anti-ulcer agents. [References: 75]
