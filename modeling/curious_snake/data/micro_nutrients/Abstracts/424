Although epilepsy is not rare, many epileptic conditions are considered to be idiopathic and the related seizures of unknown origin. It does appear that different types of seizures are caused by differing mechanisms. This paper discusses scattered case reports involving problems with calcium metabolism and the thyroid, and/or the parathyroid glands concurrent with seizures that support the position that calcium control mechanisms may have been involved in causing seizures in those patients. This paper hypothesizes that calcium levels can cause, or at least contribute to myoclonic (jerk) seizures, as well as to possibly infantile spasms. As these conditions are difficult to treat medically, this paper suggests that nutritional interventions, such as supplemental calcium, magnesium and/or vitamin D, might well be considered as an option as a first-line treatment in those with these types of epileptic disorders. The nutritional recommendations also would apply for those who have seizures concurrent with Down syndrome
