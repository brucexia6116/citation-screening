Compelling evidence exists to use cinacalcet as a primary therapy for the treatment of secondary HPT in patients requiring dialysis. The benefits of directly lowering PTH in combination with improving calcium-phosphorus homeostasis provide a means to better achieve the K/DOQI bone guidelines. Cinacalcet is usually well tolerated and safe to use, making it possible to treat a wide range of patients with varying levels of disease severity. The ideal course of action for this novel therapy is for nephrology nurses and renal dietitians to use a team approach in the management of secondary HPT. [References: 17]
