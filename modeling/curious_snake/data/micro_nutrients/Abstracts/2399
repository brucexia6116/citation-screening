BACKGROUND. To ascertain the effect of the intravenous administration of magnesium in acute myocardial infarction on the frequency of arrhythmias and mortality, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed. METHODS AND RESULTS. The study included 930 patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to primary referral hospitals. Administration of magnesium in acute myocardial infarction was associated with a 49% reduction in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The incidence of cardiac arrest was reduced by 58%. The frequency of supraventricular tachycardias was also lower. Overall, there was a 54% reduction in mortality. CONCLUSIONS. Intravenous magnesium is a safe and effective method of reducing the frequency of arrhythmias and mortality in acute myocardial infarction
