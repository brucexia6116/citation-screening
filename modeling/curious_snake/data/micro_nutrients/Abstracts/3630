OBJECTIVE: To determine whether oral dextromethorphan (1 mg/kg) given one hour prior to surgery decreases opioid administration in the perioperative period in children undergoing tympanomastoid surgery. METHODS: This was a prospective randomized double-blinded and placebo-controlled study in which 20 male and 18 female children (age 11.5 +/- 3.5 years) were enrolled. Nineteen children received dextromethorphan (DM), while the other 19 received placebos. Postoperative pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale and a pain score of > or =5 was treated with intravenous morphine sulfate. Patients were discharged home on oral oxycodone. RESULTS: The total doses of fentanyl administered during surgery were higher in the placebo group compared to the DM group (4.1 +/- 2 vs 2.6 +/- 1.4 microg/kg, P = 0.02) and the total doses of intravenous morphine administered in the postoperative period were also higher in the placebo group compared to the DM group (150 +/- 80 vs 73 +/- 56 microg/kg, P = 0.004). The placebo group had a higher pain score at the time of admission to the Day Surgery Unit (DSU) and a higher maximum pain score, compared to the DM group, during their combined stay in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit and DSU (7.3 +/- 1.5 vs 3.1 +/- 2.6, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Premedication with DM reduces the need for opioid administration in the perioperative period in children undergoing tympanomastoid surgery. EBM rating: A
