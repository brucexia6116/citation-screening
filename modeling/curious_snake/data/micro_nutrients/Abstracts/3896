Management of psoriasis begins with identification of the extent of cutaneous disease. However, a holistic, contractual approach to treatment is encouraged, with particular reference to psychosocial disability and quality-of-life issues. The presence of psoriasis on palms, soles, body folds, genitals, face, or nails, and concomitant joint disease, are also important when considering treatment options. An evidence-based approach is essential in delineating differences between the many available treatments. However, archaic approaches, especially combinational ones, are routinely used by some clinicians, with inadequate prospective or comparative evidence. Treatments currently available are: topical agents used predominantly for mild disease and for recalcitrant lesions in more severe disease; phototherapy for moderate disease; and systemic agents including photochemotherapy, oral agents, and newer injectable biological agents, which have revolutionised the management of severe psoriasis. Other innovative treatments are undergoing clinical studies, with the aim of maintaining safe, long-term control of the condition. [References: 145]
