During the past decade we have seen dramatic advances in colon cancer screening. Reduction in mortality in average risk screening for colorectal cancer has now been shown in multiple trials. Efforts to increase public awareness and compliance with evidence-based screening guidelines are underway. Recent guidelines have incorporated family history, as it has been identified as a common risk factor. The genes responsible for the inherited syndromes of colon cancer have been identified and genetic testing is available. Currently, screening the average risk population over the age of 50 would reduce mortality from colon cancer by 50%. Future advances will likely include improved screening tests, and the development of familial genetic testing. [References: 90]
