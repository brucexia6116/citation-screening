Background, Malaria causes repeated illness in children living in endemic areas. Policies of giving antimalarial drugs at regular intervals (prophylaxis or intermittent treatment) are being considered for preschool children., Objectives, To evaluate chemoprophylaxis and intermittent treatment with antimalarial drugs to prevent malaria in young children living in malaria endemic areas., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (April 2005), CENTRAL ( Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1974 to April 2005), LILACS (1982 to April 2005), and reference lists of identified trials. We also contacted researchers., Selection criteria, Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing antimalarial drugs given at regular intervals (prophylaxis or intermittent treatment) with placebo or no drug in children aged one month to six years or less living in an area where malaria is endemic., Data collection and analysis, We independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. We used relative risk (RR) or weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for meta-analyses. Where we detected heterogeneity and considered it appropriate to combine the trials, we used the random-effects model (REM)., Main results, Nineteen trials (14,393 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Children receiving antimalarial drugs as prophylaxis or intermittent treatment had fewer clinical malaria episodes (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.77, REM; 4051 participants, 8 trials), and severe anaemia was less common (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.68; 2727 participants, 8 trials). We did not detect a difference in the number of deaths from any cause (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.04; 7929 participants, 9 trials), but the confidence intervals do not exclude a potentially important difference. None of the trials reported serious adverse events. Three trials measured morbidity and mortality six months to two years after stopping regular antimalarial drugs; overall, there was no statistically significant difference, but participant numbers were small., Authors' conclusions, Prophylaxis and intermittent treatment with antimalarial drugs reduce clinical malaria and severe anaemia in preschool children. There is insufficient evidence to detect an effect on mortality
