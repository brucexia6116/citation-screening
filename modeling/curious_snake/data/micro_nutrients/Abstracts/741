The dramatic increase in our understanding of the brain's development throughout childhood has increased our knowledge of the significance of micronutrients, such as iron and vitamin B-12, for this development. Deficiencies of these micronutrients have been shown to have an impact on students' cognitive development. Regardless of this knowledge, students continue to make unhealthy food choices and develop poor dietary habits. School environments are places where there is an opportunity to practice healthy eating habits. Yet many school policies fail to address the sale of foods of minimal nutritional value in the school setting. School nurses can play a vital role in planning policies at the local and national level that support and encourage healthy food environments, performing assessments of the nutritional status of students, and spearheading the implementation of evidence-based health promotion programs. It is time for school nurses to take the lead in efforts aimed at improving the quality of students' dietary intake in the school setting. [References: 44]
