The importance of diet on the development and progression of prostate cancer was initially suggested by epidemiological studies. Since then, there has been a vast amount of research in this field. Compelling evidence now provides hope that evidence-based dietary alterations may markedly alter the natural history of this disease. Is there enough evidence for clinicians to be able to advise dietary modifications? The preliminary results no doubt are encouraging, but at present there seems to be no evidence to justify the widespread use of these proposed dietary interventions. However, as public awareness increases, all physicians involved with the care of patients with cancer of the prostate will need to be better armed with the current updates and advice on this issue.
