BACKGROUND: Studies from Asia have suggested that zinc supplementation can reduce morbidity and mortality in children, but evidence from malarious populations in Africa has been inconsistent. Our aim was to assess the effects of zinc supplementation on overall mortality in children in Pemba, Zanzibar. METHODS: We enrolled 42,546 children aged 1-36 months, contributing a total of 56,507 child-years in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Pemba, Zanzibar. Randomisation was by household. 21 274 children received daily supplementation with zinc 10 mg (5 mg in children younger than 12 months) for mean 484.7 days (SD 306.6). 21,272 received placebo. The primary endpoint was overall mortality, and analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial, number ISRCTN59549825. FINDINGS: Overall, there was a non-significant 7% (95% CI -6% to 19%; p=0.29) reduction in the relative risk of all-cause mortality associated with zinc supplementation. INTERPRETATION: We believe that a meta-analysis of all studies of mortality and morbidity, will help to make evidence-based recommendations for the role of zinc supplementation in public health policy to improve mortality, morbidity, growth, and development in young children
