OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview on the current status of the long-term outcomes of instrumental treatment options for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms that are suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction. METHODS: Based on MEDLINE database searches, we performed a systematic review of the literature with a focus on peer-reviewed articles about surgical benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) therapy published between 2000 and 2005. Special emphasis was given to randomized controlled trials on long-term outcome with a minimum follow-up of five years. RESULTS: Data on clinical outcome with a follow-up of more than 10 years are available for open prostatectomy (OP), transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and transurethral microwave therapy. Studies with a follow-up of at least five years are obtainable for transurethral incision of the prostate, transurethral vaporisation of the prostate, transurethral needle ablation of the prostate, Holmium:YAG laser enucleation of the prostate, potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser vaporization of the prostate, and interstitial laser coagulation of the prostate. Among these long-term reports, OP and TURP provide the most durable results. CONCLUSIONS: The most substantial long-term data on surgical procedures for BPH are available for conventional therapy, namely TURP. Concerning the techniques that have emerged within the last decade, there is clear evidence that the outcomes are more sustainable for truly ablative and thus deobstructing procedures.
