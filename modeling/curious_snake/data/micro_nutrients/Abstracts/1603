BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in men. Published randomised controlled trials assessing the benefits of therapy in men with osteoporosis are limited, but those available need to be used to develop management guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To present evidence based guidelines for the treatment of osteoporosis in men. DISCUSSION: It is estimated that 30-60% of men presenting with spinal fractures have another illness contributing to their bone disease. Therefore assessment and treatment of coexisting medical conditions is a vital part of management of osteoporosis. While primary prevention of fractures remains crucial, treatment to ensure further fractures do not occur is equally important. Alendronate is the treatment of choice for men with osteoporosis and fractures, with cyclical etidronate an appropriate alternative and testosterone replacement therapy is indicated in hypogonadal men presenting with osteoporosis.
