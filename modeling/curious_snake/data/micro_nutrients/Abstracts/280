PURPOSE: VITA In-Ceram Classic is a system designed to fabricate all-ceramic crowns and fixed partial dentures (FPDs) with a glass-infiltrated aluminum oxide core material. This systematic literature review gives an overview of the clinical performance of the VITA In-Ceram Classic Alumina, Spinell, and Zirconia restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on a systematic literature review, an evidence-based selection and assessment of clinical studies of VITA In-Ceram Classic ceramics was carried out. RESULTS: A total of 299 publications were found, 21 of which met the inclusion criteria. Only a few meaningful studies of In-Ceram Alumina FPDs and In-Ceram Zirconia crowns and FPDs were found. The 5-year survival rate of In-Ceram Alumina crowns and In-Ceram Spinell crowns ranged from 91.7% to 100% and is similar to the survival rate of conventional metal-ceramic crowns. The 5-year survival rate of single-retainer In-Ceram Alumina resin-bonded FPDs (RBFPDs) was 92.3%, which is higher than that of 2-retainer RBFPDs. CONCLUSION: In-Ceram Classic Alumina can be recommended for anterior and posterior crowns as well as for anterior single-retainer RBFPDs. Further studies should be initiated to evaluate in detail the clinical performance of In-Ceram Classic Alumina FPDs. In-Ceram Classic Spinell can be recommended for anterior crowns, especially if highly esthetic results are requested. For In-Ceram Classic Zirconia crowns or FPDs no statement can be made presently because of insufficient data. [References: 46]
