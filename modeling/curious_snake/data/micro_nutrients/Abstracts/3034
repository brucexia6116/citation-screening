Background, Peptic ulcer disease is the cause for dyspepsia in about 10% of patients. 95% of duodenal and 70% of gastric ulcers are associated with . Eradication of reduces the relapse rate of ulcers but the magnitude of this effect is uncertain., Objectives, The primary outcomes were the proportion of peptic ulcers healed initially and proportion of patients free from relapse following successful healing. Eradication therapy was compared to placebo or pharmacological therapies in positive patients. Secondary aims included symptom relief and adverse effects., Search strategy, Searches were conducted on the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials - CENTRAL (which includes the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group Trials Register) on The Cochrane Library (Issue 3 2002) MEDLINE (1966 to July 2002) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2002). Reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching were handsearched to identify further relevant trials. Published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) were handsearched. The search was updated in September 2003, November 2004 and November 2005. Members of the Cochrane UGPD Group, and experts in the field were contacted and asked to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials, Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of short and long-term treatment of peptic ulcer disease in positive adults were analysed. Patients received at least one week of H pylori eradication compared with ulcer healing drug, placebo or not treatment. Trials were included if they reported assessment from 2 weeks onwards., Data collection and analysis, Data were collected on ulcer healing, recurrence, relief of symptoms and adverse effects., Main results, 63 trials were eligible. Data extraction was not possible in 7 trials, and 56 trials were included. In duodenal ulcer healing, eradication therapy was superior to ulcer healing drug (UHD) (34 trials, 3910 patients, relative risk [RR] of ulcer persisting = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58, 0.76) and no treatment (2 trials, 207 patients, RR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.26, 0.53). In gastric ulcer healing, no significant differences were detected between eradication therapy and UHD (14 trials, 1572 patients, RR = 1.25; 95% CI = 0.88, 1.76). In preventing duodenal ulcer recurrence no significant differences were detected between eradication therapy and maintenance therapy with UHD (4 trials, 319 patients, relative risk [RR] of ulcer recurring = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.42, 1.25), but eradication therapy was superior to no treatment (27 trials 2509 patients, RR = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.15, 0.26). In preventing gastric ulcer recurrence, eradication therapy was superior to no treatment (11 trials, 1104 patients, RR = 0.29; 95% CI 0.20, 0.42)., Authors' conclusions, A 1 to 2 weeks course of eradication therapy is an effective treatment for positive peptic ulcer disease
