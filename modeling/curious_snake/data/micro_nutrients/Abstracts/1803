Antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection should be based on the natural history of HCV infection; there is a sequential, but slow, progression from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis, leading to death from either liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The risk of HCC development increases in association with the advance of fibrosis, and antiviral therapy can reduce this risk. More than 30 indices have been proposed as 'predictors' of favourable response to IFN therapy: host factors (age, gender, duration of HCV-infection, alcohol intake, hepatic iron stores, platelet count, histological staging of the liver disease), viral factors (HCV RNA levels in serum, HCV subtype, diversity of the hypervariable region, mutation of non-structure 5A gene), and IFN factors (dose, duration of treatment, type, treatment regimens i.e. every day vs three times a week, escalating dose regimen). Before starting IFN therapy, HCV subtype and pretreatment HCV RNA load, as well as the fibrotic stage of the liver, should be determined. The response to IFN therapy should be monitored by the HCV RNA status in serum during therapy, and the treatment regimen modified, or discontinued as required. A sustained virological response should be checked at more than 3 months after the completion of therapy. Even though the risk of HCC is markedly reduced in sustained responders, it is possible to develop HCC several years after completion of IFN therapy
