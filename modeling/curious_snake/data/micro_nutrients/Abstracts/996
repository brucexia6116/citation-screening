To study the effectiveness for the treatment of intermittent claudication (IC) of three drugs with antiplatelet effects, cilostazol, beraprost sodium, and prostaglandin E(1) (PGE(1)), by using a systemic review of literature and a meta-analysis. A search was undertaken for studies reported between 1966-2002 in the MEDLINE database, and references in published articles and reviews were obtained. Data for maximum walking distance (MWD), pain-free walking distance (PFWD), and adverse clinical events were extracted from the articles that met the inclusion criteria. The pooled estimates of the weighted mean differences (WMD) of MWD and PFWD for cilostazol were 52.19 m [95% confidence interval (CI) 32.08, 72.31] and 39.75 m [95% CI 23.39, 56.10], and those for PGE(1) were 100.27 m [95% CI 15.76, 184.78] and 55.73 [95% CI 21.54, 89.92], respectively. These differences were statistically significant between the test drugs and placebo. However there was no statistical significance difference between beraprost sodium and placebo, even though there was one study that showed a tendency for improvement in walking distance. The total rate of adverse clinical events in cilostazol and beraprost sodium was higher than that for placebo, while there was no statistical significant difference between PGE(1) and placebo, although PGE(1) had a higher tendency for adverse clinical events. The literature evaluation results and the meta-analysis suggest that these two drugs (cilostazol and PGE(1)) can be considered to be effective drugs for the treatment of IC. Due to current availability of only a few clinical reports, further studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of beraprost sodium in the treatment of IC. [References: 27]
