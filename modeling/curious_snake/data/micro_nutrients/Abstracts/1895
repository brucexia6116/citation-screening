BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Meta-analysis of previous trials of oral nimodipine in acute stroke has suggested a benefit when commenced within 12 hours of onset. We sought to study the effect of oral nimodipine on reperfusion after acute stroke and the relation between reperfusion and outcome. METHODS: Fifty patients with acute middle cerebral artery territory cortical infarction were blindly randomized within 12 hours of onset to either oral nimodipine (30 mg every 6 hours) or placebo. Treatment was continued for 2 weeks. Cerebral blood flow was assessed with the use of 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission CT before therapy, 24 hours later, and at 3 months. Hypoperfusion was measured by a validated volumetric technique. Neurological impairment and functional outcome were assessed with the Canadian Neurological Scale and Barthel Index, respectively. Tissue loss was measured with CT at 3 months. Four patients were excluded from analysis for technical reasons. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients received nimodipine, and 23 received placebo. In the nimodipine group, there was early reperfusion that was not maintained at outcome (P=0.01). In the placebo group, mean infarct hypoperfusion volumes showed no overall change. Nonnutritional reperfusion in nimodipine-treated patients was associated with adverse neurological (P=0.05) and functional outcome (P=0.06). There was, however, no difference in clinical outcome between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral nimodipine administered within 12 hours enhanced acute reperfusion, but this was largely nonnutritional. Larger studies using a shorter treatment delay are required to evaluate the clinical efficacy of nimodipine in acute ischemic stroke
