OBJECTIVE: This study compared the management of chronic leg ulcers by nurses in community, primary health care and nursing home settings in Kronoberg, Sweden, and East Riding, UK. METHOD: A questionnaire was sent to all nurses in the two areas enquiring about their occupational background, leg ulcer management, resource utilisation and education and training. It also asked about their preferred treatment choices for four types of chronic leg ulcers described in case studies. Response rates of 50% (UK) and 54% (Sweden) were achieved. RESULTS: Nurses in the UK undertook diagnostic investigations of non-healing leg ulcers as part of the initial assessment, whereas in Sweden these were undertaken by physicians. In Sweden daily dressing changes were more frequent and often involved nurse auxiliaries. Patients and relatives almost never participated in dressing changes in the two countries. Sodium chloride was the most commonly used cleansing agent in the UK, as opposed to warm water in Sweden. The use of antibacterial/antiseptic dressings and antibiotics was more frequent in the UK. Nurses there also used scientific and professional literature more frequently. Swedish nurses experienced more problems in obtaining new information. CONCLUSION: Differences exist between the two countries in leg ulcer management. These may be related to differences in the health-care systems, staff training and attitudes to evidence-based practice
