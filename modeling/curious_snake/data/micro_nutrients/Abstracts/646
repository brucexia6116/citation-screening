The clinical effectiveness of vitamin B12 and its active coenzyme form on diabetic neuropathy is uncertain. Therefore, we searched the English- and non-English-language literature on this topic by using MEDLINE (Ovid, PubMed), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and related papers. We identified seven randomized controlled trials from June 1954 to July 2004 and reviewed them for the clinical effectiveness of vitamin B12 according to the following parameters: Measurement scales of somatic and autonomic symptoms or signs; vibrometer-detected thresholds of vibration perception; and, electrophysiologic measures such as nerve conduction velocities and evoked potentials. Three studies involved the use of vitamin B complex (including B12) as the active drug, and four used methylcobalamin. Two studies were of fairly good quality (Jadad score = 3/5), and five were of poor quality (Jadad score < or = 2/5). Both the vitamin B12 combination and pure methylcobalamin had beneficial effects on somatic symptoms, such as pain and paresthesia. In three studies, methylcobalamin therapy improved autonomic symptoms. Effects on vibration perception and electrophysiological measures were not consistent. With both the vitamin B12 combination and pure methylcobalamin, symptomatic relief was greater than changes in electrophysiological results. However, more high-quality, double-blind randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effects of vitamin B12 on diabetic neuropathy. [References: 18]
