A meta-analysis of 14 clinical studies with RRR- or all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (83,800 subjects) was performed to evaluate whether RRR and all-rac differ in cardiovascular efficacy based on those clinical endpoints that are most consistently documented in the publications of the studies. Odds ratios of treatment versus control for individual studies and for studies pooled by form were centered around unity, with no significant differences between vitamin E forms. The results corroborate the present opinion that vitamin E supplements up to 800 mg/d for up to 6.5 years are safe
