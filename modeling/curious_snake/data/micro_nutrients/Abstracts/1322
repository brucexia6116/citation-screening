1. The major metabolite of 2,4-dimethoxy-6-sulphanilamidopyrimidine (sulphadimethoxine) in urine in man is a non-reducing glucuronide, which has been isolated and characterized as its S-benzylthiouronium salt. 2. The same compound was made synthetically by standard methods from sodium sulphadimethoxine and methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1-bromoglucuronate. 3. On hydrolysis with acid, the glucuronide yielded sulphanilic acid, glucuronic acid and barbituric acid, and with beta-glucuronidase it slowly yielded sulphadimethoxine and glucuronic acid. 4. Evidence based on infrared spectra and other data showed that the urinary and synthetic glucuronide was 1-deoxy-1-[N(1)'-(2'',4''-dimethoxypyrimidin-6'' -yl)sulphanilamido-beta-d-glucosid]uronic acid or sulphadimethoxine N(1)-glucuronide. 5. N(1)-Methyl- and N(ring)-methyl derivatives of sulphadimethoxine and 4-methoxy-6-sulphanilamidopyrimidine were prepared and their infrared and ultraviolet spectra determined for comparison
