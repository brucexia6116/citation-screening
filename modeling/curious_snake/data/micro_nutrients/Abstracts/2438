In this review I summarize the experimental data in favor of the notion that control of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (R) and/or c-erbB-2 protooncogene expression by specific autocrine growth factors and certain classical endocrine hormones serves as a transducer of extracellular signals that ultimately lead to growth responses in breast carcinoma cells. I summarize some new results on the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha, and TGF beta in the control of EGF-R protooncogene expression in human breast carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the data embracing the hypothesis that the growth actions of hormone receptors that are homologous to the v-erbA oncogene (estrogens, progesterone, thyroid hormones, retinoic acid, and vitamin D) are mediated, in part, by modulating EGF-R and/or c-erbB-2 protooncogene transcription are reviewed. Finally, I develop the theme that cooperation of certain c-erb-A-related, c-erbB-2 and/or EGF-R gene products contribute to the uncontrolled growth of human mammary carcinoma cells. From the evidence reviewed, one can infer that elucidation of the molecular control of EGF-R/c-erbB-2 gene expression by c-erbA-related gene products may lead to both a better understanding of breast carcinogenesis and a new therapeutic approach directed at controlling the transcriptional responses of EGF-R/c-erbB-2 genes.
