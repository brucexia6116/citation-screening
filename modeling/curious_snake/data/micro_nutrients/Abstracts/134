Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common complaint that affects millions of people worldwide. As there is no cure for OA, drug treatment is the main form of management. This can be achieved through the use of analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs such as the NSAID diclofenac sodium. The chronic use of diclofenac sodium can lead to adverse gastrointestinal problems. The use of a topical formulation of diclofenac sodium aims to reduce this problem. Evidence from four randomized controlled trails of the efficacy and safety of topical diclofenac sodium as a method of pain relief for the treatment of OA of the knee is presented and discussed. Findings imply that topical diclofenac sodium is an efficacious and safe method of pain control in patients with OA of the knee. [References: 35]
