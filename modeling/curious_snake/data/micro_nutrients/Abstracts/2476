This report reviews the methods and findings of published clinical studies comparing dentifrices containing sodium fluoride (NaF) and sodium monofluorophosphate (Na2PO3F) for the purpose of determining whether sodium fluoride formulations have superior cariostatic effects. Nine of ten reported trials found a numerical advantage for sodium fluoride dentifrices with highly compatible abrasive systems and the hypothesis that these two fluoride agents have equivalent cariostatic effects is rejected (p = 0.011). Therefore, the collective clinical evidence demonstrates that dentifrices containing NaF have greater cariostatic effectiveness than dentifrices containing Na2PO3F
