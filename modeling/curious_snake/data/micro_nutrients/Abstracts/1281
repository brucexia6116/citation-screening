BACKGROUND: In 1994, a meta-analysis of 5 small randomized trials reported a 30% reduction in the odds of angiographic restenosis when calcium-channel blockers (CCB) were given after percutaneous coronary intervention. Recently, the results of 2 large similar trials (Nisoldipine In Coronary Artery Disease in Leuven [NICOLE], and Coronary AngioPlasty Amlodipine in REstenosis Study [CAPARES]) were published. An extended meta-analysis including the results of the latter trials was performed. METHODS: A total of 2380 patients were analyzed. Statistical analysis included calculation of odds ratios for each trial, common odds ratio, and homogeneity for treatment effects across trials. RESULTS: The incidence of angiographic restenosis was 36% in the CCB-treated group and 42% in the placebo group. The odds ratio of restenosis with CCB therapy was 0.78 (95% CI 0.64-0.95) compared with control patients (P =.01). Treatment effects were homogeneous across the trials. For the combined end point of death, coronary artery bypass grafting, repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and myocardial infarction, 126 of 626 events occurred in the CCB group and 191 of 655 in the placebo group (odds ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.47-0.80], P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: This extended meta-analysis confirmed a reduction in the odds of restenosis and clinical events when CCBs were added to standard therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention
