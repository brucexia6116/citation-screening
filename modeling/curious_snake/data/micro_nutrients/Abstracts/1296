OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this overview is to synthesise and summarise the findings and recommendations of all 14 projects funded between 1997 and 2002 under Phase 2 of the Department of Health's Policy Research Programme Nutrition Initiative. This is aimed at end users, including policy makers, practitioners, researchers and research funding bodies. DESIGN: The main findings and recommendations for policy and practice, as well as for future research, contained in the peer-reviewed final report of each project are summarised under headings identified as being useful for policy groups and practitioners: Maintenance of a healthy weight; Functional outcomes related to different markers of iron status; Nutritional aspects of bone health in humans; and Dietary interventions. RESULTS: The overview draws together the key findings and recommendations for current and future policy and practice from the second phase of the research programme and identifies research gaps. CONCLUSIONS: The findings and recommendations of the Department of Health's Nutrition Research Initiative have contributed to the scientific evidence base for policy development, policy evaluation, and will inform practitioners as well as researchers and research funding bodies.
