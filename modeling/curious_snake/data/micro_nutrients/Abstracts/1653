Isolated systolic hypertension affects over 15% of all people older than 60 years. In the elderly, systolic hypertension is a major modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Systolic blood pressure is associated with higher risk of an adverse outcome, whereas diastolic blood pressure is inversely correlated with total mortality, independent of systolic blood pressure, highlighting the role of pulse pressure as risk factor. Three placebo-controlled outcome trials on antihypertensive drug treatment in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension have been published: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), the Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial and the Systolic Hypertension in China (Syst-China) Trial. These three trials demonstrated the benefit of antihypertensive drug treatment. A meta-analysis was performed by pooling the patients from these three trials with a subset of patients with isolated systolic hypertension from five other trials in the elderly. Antihypertensive treatment based on a calcium-channel blocker may provide additional benefits in diabetic patients and in the prevention of dementia and renal dysfunction. The pooled results of 15693 older patients with isolated systolic hypertension prove that antihypertensive drug treatment is justified if on repeated clinic measurements systolic blood pressure is 160 mmHg or higher
