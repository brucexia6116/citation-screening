Several studies have recently been published which have raised doubts over the long-term safety of calcium channel blockers (CCB). These have included retrospective case control studies in hypertension and meta-analyses of small scale studies in unstable angina and myocardial infarction (MI). Most of the reports were primarily concerned with the use of the short acting dihydropyridine nifedipine. Despite wide media coverage of these reports, the results are by no means irrefutable and, because of the nature of the studies themselves, are open to several criticisms. Calcium channel blockers are currently being evaluated in large-scale, prospective, randomised controlled studies, but results are unlikely to be available within the next few years. Meanwhile, the consensus view seems to be that short acting dihydropyridines should in general be avoided and have no place in the management of unstable angina and post MI. In the setting of stable angina, long acting dihydropyridines should generally be used in conjunction with a beta-blocker. In hypertensive patients, long acting dihydropyridines may be used as alternative antihypertensive agents in patients in whom the first line agents (diuretics and beta-blockers) are poorly tolerated, contra-indicated or ineffective
