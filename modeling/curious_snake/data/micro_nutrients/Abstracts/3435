This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, The primary objective of this systematic review is to determine whether enteral iron supplementation improves the growth and neurodevelopmental outcome of premature and low birth weight infants., The secondary objectives are:, (a) To determine whether iron supplementation results in improved haematological parameters and body iron stores in premature and low birth weight infants, (b) To assess whether enteral iron supplementation to these infants prevents other causes of morbidity and mortality, (c) To determine the optimum dosage and timing of enteral iron supplementation, A subgroup analysis will separately compare trials involving exclusively formula-fed infants, and those involving exclusively or partially breast-fed infants., Data permitting, further sub-group analyses are planned to determine whether outcomes differ by:, i. Postnatal age of commencement of iron supplementation, ii. Total duration of iron supplementation, iii. Daily dose of supplemental iron administered, iv. Gestational age at birth of subjects, vi. Birth weight of subjects
