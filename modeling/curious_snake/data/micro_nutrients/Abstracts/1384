BACKGROUND: The Multicenter Trial of Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity (CRYO-ROP) demonstrated the efficacy of treatment for threshold ROP and indicated the need for worldwide ROP screening. Previous guidelines for ROP screening have been largely based on clinical impression; we can now develop evidence-based screening recommendations. OBJECTIVE: To define the appropriate ages and retinal ophthalmoscopic signs that determine when to commence and conclude acute phase ROP screening. DESIGN: Analysis of data from 2 prospective randomized controlled trials: CRYO-ROP (January 1, 1986, to November 30, 1987) and Light Reduction in ROP (LIGHT-ROP) (July 1, 1995, to March 31, 1997). SETTING: Neonatal intensive care units in 23 study centers in the United States for CRYO-ROP and 3 centers for LIGHT-ROP. PATIENTS: Eyes were examined sequentially in 4099 infants with birth weight less than 1251 g (CRYO-ROP study) and in 361 infants with birth weight less than 1251 g and gestational age less than 31 weeks (LIGHT-ROP study). RESULTS: In 99% of infants, retinal conditions indicating a risk of poor outcome were not observed before 31 weeks' postmenstrual age or 4 weeks' chronologic age. Signs indicating that the risk of visual loss from ROP was minimal or had passed were the infant's attainment of 45 weeks' postmenstrual age without the development of prethreshold ROP or worse, progression of retinal vascularization into zone III without previous zone II ROP, and full vascularization. CONCLUSIONS: The initial eye examination should be conducted by 31 weeks' postmenstrual age or 4 weeks' chronologic age, whichever is later. Acute phase ROP screening can be discontinued when any of the 3 signs is present, indicating that the risk of visual loss from ROP is minimal or passed
