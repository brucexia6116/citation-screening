Patients with low bone density or any prior low trauma fracture should be considered for therapeutic intervention. Oestrogen replacement therapy remains the first choice for prevention of bone loss in early postmenopausal women with low bone density. In postmenopausal women with existing fractures, the rank order of treatments is firstly alendronate, secondly raloxifene and thirdly less potent bisphosphonates, such as etidronate, or active vitamin D metabolites, such as calcitriol. For men with osteoporosis, if hypogonadism is present, it should be treated with testosterone replacement therapy. Despite limited data, a bisphosphonate should then be considered in conjunction with calcium. Supplementation with simple vitamin D should be considered in elderly patients who are housebound or live in institutions, as they are at risk of vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia.
