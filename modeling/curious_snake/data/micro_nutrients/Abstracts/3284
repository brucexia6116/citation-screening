This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, (1) To evaluate the effectiveness of oral products (chewing gum pellets, chewing gum sticks, mints, lozenges, mouthrinses, toothpaste, etc.) containing high levels of xylitol on dental caries rates as compared with alternative treatments, placebo, or no treatment., (2) To assess if there are optimal parameters of administration: dose, frequency., (3) To assess differences in effectiveness in high and low caries risk populations. To assess if the various means for designating 'high risk' have different effects on reported xylitol efficacy., (4) To describe reported side effects (such as gastrointestinal upset, change in weight, or temporomandibular joint complaints), rate of occurrence, and potential to significantly interfere with treatment. It is recognized that studies included in the review of effectiveness may not provide a comprehensive summary of side effects., The following null hypotheses will be tested:, (1) There is no difference in caries rates between individuals using oral products (e.g., chewing gum, mints, lozenges, mouthrinses, toothpaste, etc.) containing high levels of xylitol compared with alternative treatments, placebo, or no treatment., (2) There is no difference in caries rates between individuals using xylitol containing oral products according to different parameters of administration (dose, frequency)., (3) There is no difference in effect between high and low caries risk populations
