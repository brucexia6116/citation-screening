OBJECTIVE: To review pregabalin's pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse effects in the treatment of neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and anxiety. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1993-October 2005) for peer-reviewed English-language publications was performed. Abstracts from professional meetings were also included. Key terms were anxiety, diabetic neuropathy, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, pregabalin, and seizures. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Basic pharmacology data were extracted from animal studies; pharmacokinetic data were extracted from human studies. Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies were included to describe the efficacy and adverse effects of pregabalin. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pregabalin is a new agent that exerts its pharmacodynamic effect by modulating voltage-gated calcium channels. Pregabalin has a linear pharmacokinetic profile. It is completely absorbed, not bound to plasma proteins, not metabolized, and eliminated unchanged through the kidneys. Doses must be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. Clinical trials showed that pregabalin is effective in neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, in partial epilepsy as adjunctive therapy, and in generalized and social anxiety disorders. The most common adverse effects were dizziness and somnolence. Few serious adverse effects were reported. Pregabalin should not be discontinued rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: Pregabalin is an effective and safe analgesic, antiepileptic, and anxiolytic medicine. It will provide a new treatment option for patients with neuropathic pain and partial epilepsy
