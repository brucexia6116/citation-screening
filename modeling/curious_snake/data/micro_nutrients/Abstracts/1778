Hypertension affects about 5% of western populations and in the majority of cases it is of unknown aetiology. It exposes the heart to greater levels of myocardial stretch as a result of increased systolic pressure and peripheral resistance. Under certain circumstances myocardial stretch may trigger arrhythmias but the mechanisms and clinical importance of this phenomenon are unclear. This article outlines the risks of sudden cardiac death conferred by hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, presents the results of experiments using an animal model of myocardial stretch and discusses some possible mechanisms underlying stretch-induced arrhythmias which may be important in hypertensive patients.
