Background, Achalasia is a disease that impairs oesophageal motility. Though nitrates have been used to treat achalasia for a long time, the effectiveness of nitrates for achalasia is still controversial., Objectives, To quantify short-term and long-term effects of nitrate therapy in patients with achalasia., Search strategy, Trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 4-2001), MEDLINE (1966-2001), EMBASE (1980-2001), LILACS - Latin American and Caribbean health science literature (1982-2001) and CBM-Chinese Biomedical database(1980-2000). Additionally, all references in the identified trials were checked for further relevant trials. An updated search was run on the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE in September 2003, October 2004 and September 2005 - no new trials were found., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials involving achalasic patients given any type of nitrates were included., Data collection and analysis, Data were extracted by two independent observers based on the intention to treat principle., Main results, Two randomised cross-over studies were found, but no results are included. Due to the design of the studies and the method of reporting the results in the original paper it was not possible to extract the necessary information to examine any of the outcomes., Authors' conclusions, We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. Appropriately designed parallel group randomised controlled trials with long term follow-up are needed to determine the effects of nitrates
