Background, At the end of 1998 over 33 million people were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and over one million children had been infected from their mothers., Objectives, The objective of this review was to assess what interventions may be effective in decreasing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection as well as their effect on neonatal and maternal mortality and morbidity., Search strategy, The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched., Selection criteria, Randomised trials comparing any intervention aimed at decreasing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection compared with placebo or no treatment, or any two or more interventions aimed at decreasing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection., Data collection and analysis, Trial quality assessments and data extraction were undertaken by the reviewer., Main results, Zidovudine, Four trials comparing zidovudine with placebo involving 1585 participants were included. Compared with placebo, there was a significant reduction in the risk of mother-to-child transmission with any zidovudine (relative risk (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.69). There is no evidence that 'long course therapy' is superior to 'short course therapy'., Nevirapine, One trial compared intrapartum and postnatal nevirapine with intrapartum and postnatal zidovudine in 626 women, the majority of whom breast fed their infants. Compared with zidovudine, there was a significant reduction in the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV with nevirapine (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.83). No trials are available comparing nevirapine with placebo., Caesarean section, One trial comparing elective caesarean section with anticipation of vaginal delivery involving 436 participants was included. Compared with vaginal delivery, there was a significant reduction in the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection with caesarean section (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.55)., Immunoglobulin, One trial comparing hyperimmune immunoglobulin plus zidovudine with non-specific immunoglobulin plus zidovudine involving 501 participants was included. The addition of hyperimmune immunoglobulin to zidovudine does not appear to have any additional effect on the risk of mother-to-child transmission (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.29-1.55)., Authors' conclusions, Zidovudine, nevirapine and delivery by elective caesarean section appear to be very effective in decreasing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection
