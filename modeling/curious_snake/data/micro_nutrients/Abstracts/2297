In an era of increasing scrutiny regarding use of health care resources, it is critical that physicians have rational, evidence-based guidelines for treatment decisions. This review of more than 200 published papers constitutes a comprehensive approach to evaluating the current evidence regarding the clinical use of recombinant human erythropoietin therapy in renal failure patients. After this review, specific recommendations are provided regarding who should receive r-HuEPO; what the target hemoglobin should be; the best route of administration of r-HuEPO; how iron status should be evaluated and managed; and monitoring and follow-up of patients taking r-HuEPO. Throughout the article, areas for important future research are also identified. [References: 205]
