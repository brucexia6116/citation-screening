OBJECTIVE: Emergent neurosurgery may be precipitated or complicated by previous or concomitant administration of anticoagulants, thrombolytic medications, or antiplatelet agents. Recommendations are presented to reverse or counteract the effects of those drugs before or during neurosurgical interventions. METHODS: Directed literature review. RESULTS: Evidence-based data specific to neurosurgery are limited. CONCLUSION: Other clinical experience based on mechanisms of drug action within the coagulation process confirm that single or combined administration of platelet transfusions, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, vitamin K, protamine, desmopressin, and recombinant activated factor VII can treat coagulopathies caused by warfarin, heparin, aspirin, adenosine diphosphate-receptor antagonist, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blocking agents, and thrombolysis. Specific interventions and recommended dosages are reviewed. [References: 53]
