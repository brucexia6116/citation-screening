Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is a common but still relatively neglected problem, with a low level of awareness among primary and secondary care physicians. Fractures appear early after initiation of treatment, and effective prophylaxis requires primary prevention in those at high risk of fracture. Bisphosphonates are the treatment of choice, and calcium and vitamin D supplements are also indicated in the majority of individuals. Organized care programs together with the use of evidence-based guidelines have the potential to improve significantly the management of this serious complication of glucocorticoid therapy.
