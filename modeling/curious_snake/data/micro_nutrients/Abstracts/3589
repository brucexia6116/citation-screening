This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, To assess the analgesic efficacy of amide local anaesthetic for pain relief after surgical removal of third molar teeth, compared to placebo, or to another local anaesthetic and administered pre-operatively or post-operatively., To test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in pain relief achieved by an amide local anaesthetic and placebo in patients following surgical removal of third molar teeth against the alternative hypothesis of a difference., To test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in pain relief achieved by different amide local anaesthetics in patients following surgical removal of third molar teeth against the alternative hypothesis of a difference., To test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in pain relief achieved by different doses or timing of administration of the same amide local anaesthetic in patients following surgical removal of third molar teeth against the alternative hypothesis of a difference., For each null hypothesis, the amide local anaesthetic may be used alone, with sedation or with general anaesthesia, providing the use of sedation and general anaesthesia are the same in both treatment and control groups. When patients are treated under local anaesthesia alone, then the placebo arm is not relevant
