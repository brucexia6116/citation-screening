OBJECTIVE: To identify new and underutilized technologies to reduce maternal mortality related to puerperal sepsis in developing countries. METHOD: Review of current medical literature. RESULT: The literature indicates that infection-control protocols and evidence-based procedures--including prophylactic antibiotics for cesarean section or preterm rupture of membranes, and updated antibiotic regimens--should be widely adopted. Devices such as hand rubs, needle-disposal systems, and rapid microbiological diagnostic tests can improve compliance and efficiency. Operational research on promising developments like vaginal cleansing with antiseptics, vitamin A supplementation, and prophylactic antibiotics in high-risk women is needed. CONCLUSION: Sepsis management continues to depend on good implementation of established technologies. Program-based approaches are required to improve uptake. [References: 59]
