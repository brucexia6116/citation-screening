Chronic heart failure (CHF) is increasing in prevalence worldwide, particularly in the elderly. Accordingly, this epidemic is likely to translate into a major increase in healthcare costs. Systolic heart failure is the most common cause of CHF presentations. Although the causes vary, the most common single aetiological factor is ischaemic heart disease, which accounts for approximately 50% of heart failure presentations. Research into CHF pharmacotherapy has been copious, with the focus principally centred on systolic heart failure. The evidence base for pharmacotherapy in CHF is amongst the largest currently in clinical medicine. There have been multiple trials establishing the mortality and morbidity benefits of pharmacotherapy. Amongst these, large scale trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and spironolactone have provided a sound basis for evidence-based treatment approaches to the CHF patient. Recently research interest has increased in biomedical engineering with studies being performed in biventricular pacing and mechanical hearts. Early data with biventricular pacing or cardiac resynchronisation therapy is encouraging. Diastolic heart failure alone accounts for at least 20 - 40% of CHF presentations and whilst it may occur in isolation, is most commonly seen in association with systolic heart failure. In this study, we present a broad overview of the current therapeutic modalities for the management of CHF, with particular emphasis on pharmacotherapy. [References: 56]
