Background, Esophageal cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicinal herbs are sometimes used as an adjunct to radiotherapy or chemotherapy for this type of cancer., Objectives, To assess the efficacy and possible adverse effects of the addition of Chinese medicinal herbs to treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy for esophageal cancer., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group Trials Register, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), CBM (Chinese Biomedical Database), China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chinese Cochrane Centre Controlled Trials Register and CISCOM (The Research Council for Complementary Medicine) (up to June 2004). Databases of ongoing trials, the internet and reference lists were also searched., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of radiotherapy or chemotherapy with and without the addition of Chinese medicinal herbs., Data collection and analysis, At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality., Main results, Two studies were included. The numbers of participants in these two trials were 42 and 80, 122 in total. Both studies were analysed separately because of the differences in interventions used. Although one study reported a positive result, the majority of outcome measurements from the two studies showed no significant benefit with the addition of Chinese herbal medicines to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. There was statistically significant improvement in quality of life with the additional Huachansu injection, however, no statistically significant improvement was found in short-term therapy effects, one-year survival rate or the adverse effect of radiation-induced esophagitis., Authors' conclusions, The included studies were of low quality. The results suggest Zhenxiang capsules or Huachansu injection may not improve short-term therapy effects or one-year survival rate when used as adjunct treatment to chemo- or radiotherapy in the treatment of esophageal cancer. The quality of life may be improved by Huachansu injection. The results suggest that more high-quality trials on Huachansu injection and other Chinese herbal medicines are needed in the future
