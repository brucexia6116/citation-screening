The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the caries-preventive effect of combined caries-preventive methods, defined as two or more different interventions in combination, each expected to prevent dental caries. The Medline database was searched for articles published in the period January 1966 to June 2003. Twenty-four controlled studies met the inclusion criteria, and their value as evidence was assessed according to predetermined criteria. The level of evidence for the overall conclusion regarding each method was graded according to the protocol of the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care. The scientific evidence for the combination of treatments involving fluoride that had a preventive effect on caries in children and adolescents was graded as moderate. However, for elderly patients the scientific evidence for the caries-preventive effect of different combinations of treatments was found to be incomplete. No conclusion could be drawn regarding the evidence for combinations of treatments being effective for groups at high caries risk, as the results from the identified clinical studies were conflicting.
