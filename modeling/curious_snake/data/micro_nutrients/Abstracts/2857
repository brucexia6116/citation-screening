Background, It is believed that ivermectin (a microfilaricide) could prevent blindness due to onchocerciasis. However, when given to everyone in communities where onchocerciasis is common the effects of ivermectin on lesions affecting the eye are uncertain and data on whether the drug prevents visual loss are unclear., Objectives, The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin in preventing visual acuity and visual field loss in onchocercal eye disease. The secondary aim was to assess the effects of ivermectin on lesions affecting the eye in onchocerciasis., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register, in (Issue 2 2005), MEDLINE (to May 2005), EMBASE (to May 2005), the National Research Register online (Issue 2 2005), the reference lists of identified trials and the Science Citation Index. We also contacted investigators, experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional trials., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials with at least one year follow up comparing ivermectin at 150 micrograms/kg body weight with either placebo or no treatment. Participants in the trials were people normally resident in endemic onchocercal communities with or without one or more characteristic signs of ocular onchocerciasis., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We contacted study authors for additional information. Trials varied in design and setting so no meta-analysis was performed., Main results, The review included five trials with data from 3810 participants. All the trials compared ivermectin with placebo. No statistically significant difference was observed in any trial (reporting visual acuity outcome) between ivermectin and placebo groups for visual acuity loss., Authors' conclusions, Questions about the effectiveness of ivermectin in preventing visual acuity loss have not been answered by best-available evidence
