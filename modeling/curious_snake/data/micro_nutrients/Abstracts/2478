All children under 19 years of age who are candidates of cataract surgery must be approved by the FDA and have the pediatric protocol approved by the Investigational Review Committee. Twenty-three children who were approved by FDA received 29 Sinskey-style posterior chamber intraocular lenses. Twenty-four were primary and five were secondary posterior chamber implants. Two minor complications could be attributed to the intraocular lens. Five other complications such as an opacifying posterior capsule and one retinal detachment could have occurred in any cataract procedure. The results of this series of lens implantations in children differ from previously reported studies. This difference may be attributed to the selection of the patients (i.e., all over the age of 20 months) and to the surgery technique
