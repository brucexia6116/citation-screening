According to an unreliable meta-analysis, epoetin beta reduces the number of premature neonates needing transfusions for anaemia by 18% on average. When such children do require transfusions, two comparative trials have shown a reduction in the frequency of transfusions and total volume of blood transfused, but the clinical consequences were not studied. Thus clinical experience to date is too limited to rule out a risk of possibly severe adverse events. Furthermore, prescription of epoetin beta must be accompanied by iron supplementation, whose optimal dose and route of administration have not been established. The cost-benefit ratio of epoetin beta in the prevention of anaemia in premature infants must be thoroughly assessed in the context of national health systems
