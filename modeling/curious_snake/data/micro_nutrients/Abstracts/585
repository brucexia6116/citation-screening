Osteoporosis is one of the most serious complications of corticosteroid treatment. Loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures occur early in the course of corticosteroid treatment, and thus early recognition of fracture risk and effective intervention based on evidence-based-medicine (EBM) are needed. A study of meta-analysis representing the highest level in a hierarchy of evidence showed that when the outcome measure of interest was limited to changes in lumbar spine BMD, bisphosphonates were the most effective of the agents studied in comparison with no therapy or treatment with calcium, and were also more efficacious than either vitamin D or calcitonin; the efficacy of bisphosphonates was enhanced when used in combination with vitamin D. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) representing the second level in a hierarchy of evidence showed that bisphosphonates stabilized BMD not only in the lumbar spine, but also in the hip, and that parathyroid hormone (PTH) markedly increased lumbar spine BMD. According to the EBM, bisphosphonates and possibly PTH are suggested to be the most efficacious for preserving BMD. The efficacy of these agents in reducing the incidence of vertebral fractures in patients exposed to corticosteroids remains to be established in meta-analysis studies, although some RCTs have demonstrated the anti-fracture effects of etidronate, alendronate, and risedronate in the spine. Further RCTs of fracture prevention conducted on a large number of patients and their meta-analysis are needed to confirm the efficacy of bisphosphonates, PTH, or other agents in preventing vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.
