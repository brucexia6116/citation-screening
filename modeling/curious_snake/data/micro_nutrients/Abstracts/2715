Background, Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common recessively inherited disorder of haemoglobin affecting peoples originating from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Mediterranean basin, the Indian subcontinent, the Caribbean and South America. The homozygous state (SS) is associated with complications and a reduced life expectancy. Phytomedicines (medicine derived from plants in their original state) encompass much of what the populations most affected would encounter in terms of plant-remedies from traditional healers. There has been little in the way of systematic appraisal of their benefits., Objectives, To assess the benefits and risks of phytomedicines in people with SCD of all types, of any age, in any setting., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group HaemoglobinopathiesTrials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We performed an additional search of the bibliographic database of Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED)., Date of most recent search of the Trials Register: February 2005., Selection criteria, All randomised or quasi-randomised trials with participants of all ages with SCD, in all settings, comparing the administration of phytomedicines, by any mode to placebo or standard treatment, including blood transfusion and hydroxyurea., Data collection and analysis, Both authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from the trial., Main results, Reports of two trials were found, of which only one, including 82 participants, was eligible for inclusion in this review. This Phase IIB (pivotal) trial suggests that a phytomedicine, NIPRISAN(superscript (R)), was effective in reducing episodes of SCD crisis associated with severe pain over a six-month period. NIPRISAN(superscript (R)) did not appear to affect the risk of severe complications or the level of anaemia. No serious adverse effects were reported., Authors' conclusions, While NIPRISAN(superscript (R)), as a phytomedicine, appeared to be safe and effective in reducing crises associated with severe pain over a six-month follow-up period of this trial, further trials are required to assess its role in the management of people with sickle cell disease. The results of Phase III, multicentre trials are awaited
