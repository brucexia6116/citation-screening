Dialysis guidelines recommend aggressive management of anemia, including the use of intravenous iron (i.v.Fe) when indicated. However, few published data are available to guide the use of i.v.Fe in children, and studies are difficult to compare. In this meta-analysis we sought to combine evidence by pooling clinical trial data to determine if i.v.Fe therapy helped increase hematocrit, serum levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), and reduce erythropoietin use. We searched MEDLINE and other databases, publications, and other sources to identify as many published and unpublished trials as possible. Of 379 possible studies, nine met the criteria for inclusion and analysis. Across all nine studies, 141 patients were studied, for durations of 2 weeks to 12 months. Pooled results identified an increase in hemoglobin, hematocrit, ferritin, and TSAT levels, and reduced use of erythropoietin, with effect sizes (in standardized weighted mean differences) ranging from 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.11-1.13) to 1.86 (1.58-2.15) standard deviation improvements. Current practice is based largely on extrapolation from adult data and a few small pediatric trials. The pooled pediatric data suggest that i.v.Fe is effective and produces moderate to large effects on the reported outcomes. Prospective, multi-center trials are needed to determine the optimal utilization of i.v.Fe in children
