The symptomatic postmenopausal woman with breast cancer presents the clinician with a difficult task with respect to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). All of the published meta-analyses have been consistent in showing that there is a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer in those patients using postmenopausal estrogens for greater than 10 years. However, there have been no published placebo-controlled clinical trials on the effects of HRT in women with a history of breast cancer. Quality of life must be balanced against the theoretical risk of tumor promotion. Assessment of osteoporotic and cardiac risk factors (i.e., smoking, hypertension, family history, hyperlipidemia) should influence the decision. Valid alternatives to estrogen replacement include low-dose progesterones such as Bellergal or vitamin E for hot flashes, and biphosphonates, calcium, anabolic steroids, and calcitonin for osteoporosis
