Multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) is an investigation that can simultaneously measure multiple electroretinographic responses at different retinal locations by cross-correlation techniques. mfERG therefore allows topographic mapping of retinal function in the central 40-50 degrees of the retina. The strength of mfERG lies in its ability to provide objective assessment of the central retinal function at different retinal areas within a short duration of time. Since the introduction of mfERG in 1992, mfERG has been applied in a large variety of clinical settings. This article reviews the clinical applications of mfERG based on the currently available evidence. mfERG has been found to be useful in the assessment of localized retinal dysfunction caused by various acquired or hereditary retinal disorders. The use of mfERG also enabled clinicians to objectively monitor the treatment outcomes as the changes in visual functions might not be reflected by subjective methods of assessment. By changing the stimulus, recording, and analysis parameters, investigation of specific retinal electrophysiological components can be performed topographically. Further developments and consolidations of these parameters will likely broaden the use of mfERG in the clinical setting. [References: 329]
