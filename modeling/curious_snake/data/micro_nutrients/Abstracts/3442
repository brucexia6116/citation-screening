This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, To assess the effect of interventions to increase retinal screening rates among persons with diabetes., Primary research questions, 1. What interventions are effective in improving retinal screening rates among persons with diabetes?, Secondary research questions, If interventions that improve retinal screening rates are found, analyses will be undertaken to answer the following secondary research questions:, 1. What characteristics of the diabetic population correlate with improved screening rates? Potential characteristics include age, sex, race, type of diabetes, duration of diabetes insulin usage, education, socioeconomic status, and presence of co-morbidities., 2. What characteristics of the provider delivering or associated with the intervention modify the effect of interventions on screening rates? Potential characteristics include primary versus specialty provider, size of practice, provider age and sex, years since graduation from medical school, number of associated providers in a group practice, and use of electronic medical records., 3. What characteristics of the health care system modify the effect of interventions on screening rates? Potential characteristics include access to treatment for retinal abnormalities (insurance, distance to specialty services), characteristics of the health care delivery system (for example payment mechanisms (fee-for-service, global capitation), managed care, carve-in versus carve-out disease management), public versus private systems of care., 4. Does the specific technique for retinal screening affect screening rates?, 5. What is the economic efficiency of interventions for improving screening rates for diabetic retinopathy?, 6. Should different approaches for improving screening rates be used for different populations, providers, and settings?
