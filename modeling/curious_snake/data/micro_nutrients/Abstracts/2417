Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk indicator of cardiovascular disease. Obtaining reversal of hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy seems to be a desirable objective of antihypertensive treatment. A total of 2,357 patients were included in a meta-analysis on the effect of antihypertensive pharmacological therapy on LVH. Overall left ventricular mass (LVM) was reduced by 11.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 10.1-13.7) in parallel with a reduction of mean arterial pressure of 14.9% (CI 14.0 to 15.8). When evaluating the effect of first-line therapies on calculated LVM using the same formula for all studies, the absolute reductions in g were 44.7 (ACE-inhibitors), 22.8 (beta-blockers), 26.9 (calcium antagonists) and 21.4 (diuretics) when adjusted for differences between studies (ANCOVA). It can be concluded that effective antihypertensive therapy reduces LVM. ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists reduce LVM by reducing wall hypertrophy, the effect of ACE-inhibitors being the most pronounced. Diuretics reduce LVM mainly through an effect on left ventricular inner diameter. How these effects affect prognosis is still an open question
