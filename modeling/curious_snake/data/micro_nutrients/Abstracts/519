The relationship between serum triglyceride levels and cardiovascular disease has remained enigmatic despite four decades of research. The majority of the available evidence tends to support the role of hypertriglyceridemia as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, there are no guidelines recommending a target triglyceride level for prevention of cardiovascular disease. The focus of lipid lowering therapy still remains the reduction of global cardiovascular risk by optimizing LDL cholesterol levels. Therapeutic options for triglyceride-lowering include lifestyle modification and pharmacological agents, such as fibrates, omega 3 fatty acids and niacin. Post-hoc analyses of the Helsinki Heart Study, Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial and Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention Study suggest a beneficial effect of the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia with fibrates, mainly in obese subjects with insulin resistance. However, in order to establish the actual clinical relevance of lowering triglyceride levels, prospective trials need to be conducted with the specific purpose of studying the effects of triglyceride reduction on clinical end points, i. e. coronary events and stroke.
