There appears to be a paucity of data examining the effect of dietary antioxidants on levels of oxidative DNA damage in vivo, limiting evidence-based assessment of antioxidant efficacy, mechanisms and recommendation for optimal intake. We have examined levels of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in mononuclear cell DNA, serum and urine from subjects undergoing supplementation with 500 mg/day vitamin C. Significant decreases in DNA levels of 8-oxodG were seen, correlating strongly with increases in plasma vitamin C concentration. Furthermore we established a timecourse for sequential, significant increases in serum and urinary 8-oxodG levels. These results illustrate, for the first time in humans, the kinetics of 8-oxodG removal and processing in vivo, suggesting a role for vitamin C in the regulation of DNA repair enzymes and thereby demonstrating a non-scavenging antioxidant effect
