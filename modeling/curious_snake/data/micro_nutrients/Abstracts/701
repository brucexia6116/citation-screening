OBJECTIVE: To review current understandings of and approaches to topical psoriasis therapies and to assess their efficacies and adverse effects. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Literature from 1987 to 2003, inclusive, was reviewed via MEDLINE using the search term "psoriasis" combined with "topical treatment." Articles were prioritized based on their level of evidence, favouring double-blind, randomized controlled trials over other comparison studies. Other studies were included where level I research was unavailable. No level III research was included. MAIN MESSAGE: Psoriasis is very common and causes substantial morbidity. Because most psoriasis is mild to moderate, patients are well suited to outpatient topical therapy. Advances in topical treatments for psoriasis have kept pace with a rapidly evolving comprehension of its pathogenesis, making a review of current therapies useful for those who treat psoriasis. While research supports continued reliance on corticosteroids as first-line therapy, comparable efficacy has been shown for vitamin D analogues and topical retinoids, albeit with a slight increase in adverse effects. CONCLUSION: The combination of steroids and vitamin D analogues or topical retinoids is perhaps the most promising current treatment. It seems to have increased efficacy and fewer side effects.
