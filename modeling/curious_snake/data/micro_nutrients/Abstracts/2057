In this review the indications for the available treatments for dyslipidemias in the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) are considered, and their efficacy according to the latest studies is analyzed. As data sources the authors used the main multicenter studies performed in the last twenty years to evaluate primary and secondary prevention of CHD by correcting dyslipidemias as well as the results of meta-analyses of these studies. All treatments considered were found effective in preventing CHD morbidity and mortality to some extent. In particular, the combination of diet with niacin or hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors seems to give the best results. These drugs induce a marked reduction of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and an increase of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations. The use of diet, niacin, and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors reduces total as well as specific mortality. Treatment of dyslipidemia to prevent CHD depends on the pattern and severity of dyslipidemia, the presence of overt CHD, and the patient's response to diet. Pharmacologic treatment should be started only after dietary modifications have been tried and must be combined with diet. Drug side effects must also be considered, for they may affect patient compliance. High levels of total and LDL and low levels of HDL cholesterol are major risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis. Correcting lipid abnormalities can reduce the risk of development or progression of CHD. Diet and drugs are the main instruments available to normalize lipid levels. The choice of drug to combine with diet must be based on its specific effects on lipid metabolism, side effects, and efficacy in reducing CHD. [References: 77]
