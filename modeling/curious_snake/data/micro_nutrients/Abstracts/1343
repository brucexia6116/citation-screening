PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the histamine-1 receptor antagonists, mast cell blockers and natural agents with such actions that can be used for the topical treatment of ocular allergies. RECENT FINDINGS: Increasing evidence indicates that some histamine-1 receptor antagonists have additional actions to inhibit secretion of inflammatory mediators, especially cytokines, from ocular mast cells and other cell types. Emerging information suggests that such actions may be through regulation of intracellular calcium ion levels of NF-kappaB activation. SUMMARY: A number of available drugs and natural non-prescription agents may have anti-histaminic and anti-inflammatory actions. [References: 140]
