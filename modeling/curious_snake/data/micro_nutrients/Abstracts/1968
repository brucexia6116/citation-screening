We present a case of mid pregnancy loss with retained intrauterine contraceptive device associated with fetal Candida infection. Review of English literature identified 53 additional cases of fetal candidal infection, with 17 associated with an IUCD in situ. The presence of an IUCD was associated with delivery at a statistically significant earlier gestational age when compared to cases not associated with an IUCD (23.3 +/- 4.9 vs 31.6 +/- 7.0, p < 0.001). Seventy-seven percent of fetal candidal infections associated with an IUCD were systemic (heart, brain, liver, gastrointestinal, lung) compared to 33% of cases not associated with an IUCD. In contrast to bacterial intraamniotic infections there was a low incidence of maternal febrile morbidity. An hypothesis as to the pathogenesis of Candidal infections in the presence and absence of an IUCD is offered as well as a paradigm for the management of the gravid patient with an IUCD in situ
