OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative efficacy of antianginal drugs administered as monotherapy or in combination in patients with chronic stable angina. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed on randomized trials, published in English between 1980 and 1999, that directly compared combined treatment and monotherapy. Twenty-two articles were included, all on the comparison of -blocker monotherapies to their combination with a calcium antagonist and 10 on the comparison of calcium antagonist monotherapies to their combination with a -blocker. RESULTS: Time to 1 mm ST-segment depression, total exercise duration and time to onset of anginal pain were significantly increased with the combined therapy compared to -blocker alone (by 8, 5 and 12%, respectively). Only time to 1 mm ST-segment depression was significantly increased with the combined therapy compared to calcium antagonist alone (by 9%). For all these parameters, the adjusted differences were significant only within 6 h following drug intake and were not significant after 6 h. No analysis of safety data could be performed. CONCLUSION: As far as exercise testing is concerned, the combination of a calcium antagonist and a -blocker is statistically more effective than either monotherapy. Further studies are needed to confirm the higher efficacy after the first 6 h following drug intake. [References: 46]
