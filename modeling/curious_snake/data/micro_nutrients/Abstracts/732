Evidence-based dermatology (EBD) is the application of the principles of evidence-based medicine to the diagnosis and treatment of skin disorders. EBD does not discount the individual dermatologist's clinical judgment. In fact, EBD is based on the interaction of external evidence, the physician's clinical experience, and the patient's experience. Randomized controlled trials constitute one of the highest levels of evidence and are the gold standard for validating a therapeutic intervention. For the treatment of rosacea, oral tetracycline, topical metronidazole, topical azelaic acid, and topical sulfur/sodium sulfacetamide have been validated by more than one randomized controlled trial.
