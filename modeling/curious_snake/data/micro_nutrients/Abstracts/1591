The purpose of this review is to summarize a systematic review evaluating the evidence regarding the association between the incidence and prevalence of dental caries and: 1) socioeconomic status; 2) tooth-brushing; and 3) the use of the baby bottle. Literature was drawn from two databases, Medline and EmBase. Because of limited resources, we did not conduct hand-searching or search unpublished studies. Three thousand one hundred thirty-eight abstracts were identified, 358 reviewed, and 272 papers included in the systematic review. There is fairly strong evidence for an inverse relationship between SES and the prevalence of caries among children less than twelve years of age. The evidence for this relationship is weaker for older children and for adults because of the relatively small number of studies and methodological limitations. There is weak evidence that tooth-brushing prevents dental caries, but it is uncertain whether the effects of tooth-brushing are due to use of a fluoride dentifrice or from mechanical removal of plaque. Finally, the evidence for the relationship between prolonged use of the baby bottle and dental caries is weak. More studies directly aimed at analyzing the relationship between SES and dental caries are needed to identify factors associated with SES that contribute to dental caries risk. Tooth-brushing should continue to be recommended as a measure to prevent dental caries, particularly using a fluoride dentifrice. Recommendations regarding bottle use should continue until clear evidence about the relationship between prolonged bottle use and dental caries can be obtained
