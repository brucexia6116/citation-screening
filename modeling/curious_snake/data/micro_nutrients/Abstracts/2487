Over a 13-month period 85 babies were randomly allocated to one of three groups at birth. Babies in Group A were fed SMA Low Birth Weight, Group B Prematalac and Group C Preaptamil. A fourth group, the control group was fed expressed breast milk (EBM). The babies were studied when they were on full enteral feeds until weight was greater than 2.0 kg. Weight gain was greatest in Group B compared to the other three groups but there was no significant difference in gain of length or occipito-frontal circumference. The babies in Group B had a lower volume of feeds and lower energy intake than the other groups but had a significantly higher sodium intake which was reflected in higher mean sodium levels. This may have accounted for the increased weight gain. There was no significant difference in serum calcium, osmolality, total protein or haematocrit
