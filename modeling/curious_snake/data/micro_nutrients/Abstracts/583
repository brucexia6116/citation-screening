PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To critically evaluate and synthesize intervention research related to hot flashes in the context of cancer and to identify implications and future directions for policy, research, and practice. DATA SOURCES: Published, peer-reviewed articles and textbooks; editorials; and computerized databases. DATA SYNTHESIS: Although a variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments are available, they may not be appropriate or effective for all individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The large and diverse evidence base and current national attention on hot flash treatment highlight the importance of the symptom to healthcare professionals, including oncology nurses. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Using existing research to understand, assess, and manage hot flashes in the context of cancer can prevent patient discomfort and improve the delivery of evidence-based care.
