For diabetic patients, a goal blood pressure lower than 130/80-85 mm Hg is strongly supported by clinical trial results. We review the agents, sequence, and dosing used in clinical trials and propose a treatment algorithm. Multiagent antihypertensive therapy is required to attain goal blood pressure in most patients. Step sequences to obtain this goal are suggested. In general, we favor initial therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, followed by the addition of a diuretic. The presence of comorbid conditions may dictate variation from this scheme. The effect of antihypertensive agents on established cardiovascular diseases, proteinuria, renal function, and metabolic factors is discussed. Tailored recommendations for specific clinical scenarios are described. [References: 48]
