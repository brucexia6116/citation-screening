Naturally occurring antioxidants like vitamin E, beta-carotene, and vitamin C can inhibit the oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins. This action could positively influence the atherosclerotic process and, as a consequence, the progression of coronary heart disease. A wealth of experimental studies provide a sound biological rationale for the mechanisms of action of antioxidants, whereas epidemiological studies strongly sustain the 'antioxidant hypothesis'. To data, however, clinical trials with beta-carotene supplements have been disappointing and their use as a preventive intervention for cancer and coronary heart disease should be discouraged. Only scant data from clinical trials are available for vitamin C. As for vitamin E, discrepant results have been obtained by the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study with a low-dose vitamin E supplementation (50 mg daily) and the Cambridge Heart Antioxidant Study (400-800 mg daily). Currently ongoing are several large-scale clinical trials that will help in clarifying the role of vitamin E in the prevention of atherosclerotic coronary disease. Copyright 1999 Academic Press
