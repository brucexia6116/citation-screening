The purpose of this review was to discuss the findings of the systematic review of the management of the early carious lesion with fluoride from a European perspective. The review was checked, and the overall finding that the evidence was incomplete was confirmed. It was suggested that the reason that few data were available was that clinical trials had not been designed to answer this question and that the baseline of healthy teeth and surfaces with very early lesions were rarely quantified. The European perspective would want to identify a clinical method that could manage these lesions better than the home use of fluoride toothpaste. Future research was recommended in the form of several systematic reviews and re-analysis of existing data. Only then could further studies be recommended. In modern European dentistry, restoring these lesions is not an option
