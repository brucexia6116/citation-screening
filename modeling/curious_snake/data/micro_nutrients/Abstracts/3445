This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, (1)To evaluate the relative effectiveness of the following interventions for treating traumatised non-vital immature permanent front teeth:, (a) apexification techniques;, (b) apical plug techniques and;, (c) root strengthening procedures., (2) To evaluate any immediate and/or long-term side effects and limitations for the materials and techniques used., There is no difference between apexification and apical plug techniques as an intervention for inducing an apical barrier to facilitate root canal treatment in traumatised non-vital immature permanent front teeth., There is no difference between apexification/apical plug techniques and no treatment (not inducing an apical barrier before root canal obturation)., There is no difference in the proportion of teeth exhibiting clinical and/or radiological signs of failure following various types of treatment for inducing an apical barrier., There is no difference in the proportion of treated teeth showing root fractures whether root strengthening procedures are used or not used
