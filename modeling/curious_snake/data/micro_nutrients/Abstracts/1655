OBJECTIVES: To analyse effects of a heart rate-lowering calcium antagonist in hypertensive post-myocardial infarction patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: From three large, randomized, placebo-controlled, secondary prevention trials investigating verapamil or diltiazem (the first and second Danish Verapamil Infarction Trials and the Multicentre Diltiazem Post-Infarction Trial) data from a total of 1,325 hypertensive post-myocardial infarction patients (drugs = 667, placebo = 658) were pooled to assess effect of blinded therapy on mortality and event rates. RESULTS: Treatment with heart rate-lowering calcium antagonists was associated with significant reduction in event rates [21.4 versus 27.4%; risk ratio (RR) = 0.76, confidence interval (CI) = 0.61 -0.95, P= 0.013]. Mortality rates in the treatment group were 15.1 versus 17.5% in the control group (RR = 0.87, CI = 0.66-1.13, P= 0.296). Among the subset of 964 hypertensive patients without pulmonary congestion, there was some reduction in mortality rate (11.3 versus 15.3% in the control group; RR = 0.72, P= 0.066) and significant reduction in event rates (18 versus 24.4% for control group; RR = 0.70, P= 0.011). In patients with pulmonary congestion and hypertension, however, calcium antagonists were associated with a 25% increase in mortality (RR = 1.25, P= 0.339), while event rate RR was 1.00. After an adjustment for significant covariates, RR for mortality in treatment versus control groups was 0.76 (P= 0.159). For event rates, RR was 0.74 (P= 0.057). CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate-lowering calcium antagonists decrease event rates in hypertensive post-myocardial infarction patients, but only in those without pulmonary congestion
