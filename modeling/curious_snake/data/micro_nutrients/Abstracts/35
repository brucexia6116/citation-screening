Since the first use of intrathecal (IT) drug infusion systems in the early 1980s, these delivery systems have undergone numerous revisions making them more tolerable, easier to program, and longer lasting. Concurrent with technological advances, the indications for IT pump placement have also been continuously evolving, to the point where the most common indication is now noncancer pain. This article provides an evidence-based review of the indications, efficacy, and complications of IT drug therapy for the most commonly administered spinal analgesics. [References: 96]
