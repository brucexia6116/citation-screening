Zonisamide is an antiepilepsy drug (AED) with both sodium and calcium channel-blocking properties. This dual mechanism may predict efficacy in some refractory patients, and a broad spectrum of action against different seizure types. Zonisamide has been commercially available in Japan since 1989, and became available in the United States for treatment of adults over the age of 12 with partial-onset seizures in March 2000. Several multicenter clinical trials have been conducted in the United States over the past 15 years. These have included three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials as well as long-term open-label studies. Zonisamide was characterized in these studies as a safe and effective adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures. Zonisamide has not yet been studied in the United States as an initial monotherapy, but in one long-term study, some patients were able to discontinue other AEDs and successfully transition to monotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were somnolence, dizziness, and anorexia. Current United States labeling states that 12 patients with epilepsy receiving zonisamide had symptomatic kidney stones; however, after more than a dozen years of zonisamide use in Japan, the incidence of kidney stones associated with zonisamide remains low.
