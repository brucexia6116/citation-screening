Verapamil, the oldest calcium-channel blocker, is now being rediscovered and reevaluated in the light of new novel drug delivery systems and new evidence-based trials. Verapamil, a phenylalkylamine, is useful in the treatment of hypertension, stable angina, and narrow QRS supraventricular arrhythmias. This calcium antagonist is effective in both young and old, and both black and white hypertensive patients, and is free of metabolic side effects. Verapamil has a well-documented history as an effective antianginal agent when directly compared with a beta-blocker, and is more effective in reducing myocardial ischemia compared with amlodipine monotherapy. Because of the short half-life of verapamil, drug delivery systems are used to prolong the duration of action. Novel drug delivery systems using encapsulated beads or a modified osmotic pump have been designed to be taken at nighttime to provide maximal blood pressure reduction in the early morning hours and effective 24-hour blood pressure control, and to avoid excessive blood pressure reduction during sleep. The Verapamil in Hypertension and Atherosclerosis Study has documented equivalent effectiveness of verapamil compared with chlorthalidone, but showed superior plaque regression and reduced events in subjects with the greatest plaques with verapamil treatment. The Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm, comparing verapamil and metoprolol for stable angina, found no difference in total cardiovascular mortality or combined cardiovascular events. Other large ongoing randomized, multicenter trials, including Controlled-Onset Verapamil Investigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints and the International Verapamil-Trandolapril Study, will expand our knowledge of the role of verapamil in the treatment of hypertension.
