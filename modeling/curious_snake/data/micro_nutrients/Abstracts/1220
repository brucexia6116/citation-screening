The simultaneous occurrence of essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus is exceedingly common. In recent years the treatment of the cardiovascular and renal complications has not only become more specific but more effective. The evidence-based medicine data have been provided through many large multicenter studies and strongly support the promise not only of effective treatment in retarding the progression of target-organ involvement, but also the potential of reversal. These dramatic therapeutic improvements have been made possible by wedding the involved pathophysiologic disease mechanisms with the actions of pharmacologic agents. Inherent in this concept is the promise of retarding the development of the cardiovascular and renal morbid events and also reducing their associated mortal endpoints. [References: 50]
