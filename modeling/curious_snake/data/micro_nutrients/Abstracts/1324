In 1999, children seen in the emergency room of a developed country for watery diarrhea and dehydration will most likely receive an intravenous infusion of fluid, followed by instructions to give oral rehydration solution (ORS) and clear liquids for a day, followed by half-strength lactose-free formula. In fact, the majority of these children could best be managed with supervised ORS followed by early (within 4-6 h) refeeding of their normal diet, based on large numbers of clinical trials and a meta-analysis. In the next decade, effective therapy in addition to glucose-containing oral rehydration solutions should be available which should reduce diarrheal volume and duration of purging. These include amino acid-supplemented "Super ORSs," ORS with soluble fibers, liquid zinc, and probiotic milks containing bacteria which boost the immune response and reduce stool number. In addition, children wealthy enough to be able to afford the new tetravalent vaccine will be largely protected from dehydrating rotavirus diarrhea, the most common cause of dehydration in infants.
