AIMS: Recurrent venesection of patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease may be detrimental, with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events and symptomatic iron-deficiency. The aim of this study was to determine the venesection policies as practised in hospitals within a U.K. region and to determine if these policies followed current recommendations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-eight consultants (56% response rate) in cardiac specialties completed self-assessment questionnaires regarding the indications for and practice of venesection. Sixty-one percent of those responding were involved directly in the care of patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease and of these clinicians 97% used venesection. Indications for venesection varied, with 51% of those responding using an elevated haemoglobin per se (6.5-21.0 g. dl-1); 78% an elevated haematocrit (0.55-0.75) and 83% symptoms. Desired maintenance haemoglobin and haematocrit levels also varied greatly. Fifty percent of the consultants responding routinely screened their patients for iron deficiency and 23% felt there was no indication for investigating a low mean corpuscular volume. Only 18% of the policies described followed any evidence based principles. CONCLUSIONS: The practice of venesecting patients with congenital cyanotic heart disease varies greatly. Policies in many hospitals do not reflect the minimal benefits and considerable risks associated with recurrent venesection
