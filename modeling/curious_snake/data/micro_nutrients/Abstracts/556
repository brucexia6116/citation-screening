Calcium antagonists comprise 2 main subclasses, dihydropyridines and nondihydropyridines, and have been studied extensively in hypertensive patients. Early meta-analyses suggested that short-acting calcium antagonists were associated with higher mortality rates resulting from cardiovascular events and other etiologies. Recent meta-analyses failed to show any substantive difference between long acting calcium antagonists and other antihypertensive drug classes with regard to cardiovascular outcomes in those with low to moderate cardiovascular risk or kidney disease progression among those with stage 2 or 3 nonproteinuric kidney diseases. The data from calcium antagonist trials are consistent in that they decrease stroke incidence but fail to protect against new-onset heart failure. In people with proteinuric kidney disease, that is > 300 mg protein/gram creatinine, use of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists to lower blood pressure without the use of agents that block the renin angiotensin aldosterone system does not provide optimal slowing of nephropathy progression. This relates directly to lack of antiproteinuric effects with this subclass and not seen with nondihydropyridine agents that reduce proteinuria to a greater degree than dihydropyridines. Thus, calcium antagonists are safe and as efficacious as other antihypertensive agents to reduce cardiovascular risk. They should be avoided in people with systolic dysfunction but may be used for blood pressure lowering in people with preserved systolic function. Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists should only be used in conjunction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in proteinuric kidney disease because they will not optimally slow kidney function loss in their absence.
