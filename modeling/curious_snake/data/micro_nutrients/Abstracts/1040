Renal failure is a complex process characterized by the retention of nitrogenous waste products, electrolyte disturbances and decreased urine production. Diuretics are often prescribed as a treatment for decreased renal functioning. Diuretics induce urine production by different mechanisms of action. Diuretic therapy has not been found to decrease mortality nor decrease the need for further intervention. The current development of national framework standards will provide guidelines for the treatment of all patients suffering acute renal failure. [References: 35]
