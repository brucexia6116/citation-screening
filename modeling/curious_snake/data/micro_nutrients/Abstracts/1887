Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of death, worsening heart failure and recurrent infarction in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. They have also been shown to reduce mortality in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. They have been demonstrated to reduce major vascular events and progression of renal disease in diabetes with hypertension, compared to placebo and to calcium channel blockers. Current trials are evaluating their role in preventing major vascular events in patients with coronary artery disease, strokes and Type II diabetes who are normotensive. [References: 22]
