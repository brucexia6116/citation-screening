Background, Schistosoma mansoni is a parasite carried by freshwater snails. S. mansoni infects the intestine, liver and spleen and can be fatal., Objectives, To assess the effects of oxamniquine and praziquantel for treating S. mansoni infection., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group specialized trials register (April 2003), CENTRAL ( Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2003), EMBASE (1980 to April 2003), LILACS (April 2003), and reference lists of articles. The Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical and Brazilian Tropical Medicine Congress abstracts were hand searched, Selection criteria, Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing oxamniquine and/or praziquantel with placebo for the treatment of S. mansoni., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data., Main results, Thirteen trials met the inclusion criteria. Oxamniquine and praziquantel are effective in curing S. mansoni infection when compared to placebo. In Africa, 15 mg/kg oxamniquine is less effective than 40 mg/kg praziquantel in people older than 14 years (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.60), but no difference was shown using 30 mg/kg oxamniquine (OR 2.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 11.96). In Brazil, 15 to 19 mg/kg oxamniquine is as effective as 50 to 70 mg/kg praziquantel in people older than 14 years (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.46). Both drugs appear safe. No difference in reinfection rate between zinc supplementation and placebo has been shown., Authors' conclusions, Oxamniquine and praziquantel both appear to be effective for treatment of S. mansoni, although lower doses of oxamniquine (less than 30 mg/kg) may not be as effective in some areas
