In addition to epidemiologic studies that suggest a benefit for high intakes of alpha-tocopherol, studies of supplementation in humans have clearly shown that alpha-tocopherol decreases lipid peroxidation, platelet aggregation, and functions as a potent anti-inflammatory agent. In the five large prospective clinical trials with alpha-tocopherol therapy, four have shown a beneficial effect on cardiovascular end-points (two studies on a primary end-point and two studies on other cardiovascular end-points). Thus, the totality of evidence based on the epidemiologic data, in-vitro studies and animal models, and the clinical trials appears to support a benefit for alpha-tocopherol supplementation in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. However, definitive recommendations must await ongoing clinical trials. [References: 23]
