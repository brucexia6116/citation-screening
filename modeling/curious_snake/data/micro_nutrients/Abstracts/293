Lowering blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients reduces morbidity and mortality. However the long-term safety of some antihypertensive agents was a matter of concern. Diuretic, the gold standard treatment in hypertension may impair glucose tolerance and thereby accelerate the development of diabetes mellitus. It was also associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients. However, recent evidence showed that low-medium dose of thiazide diuretic especially when given in combination with potassium sparing agent is effective in reducing BP and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Beta blockers are less effective than other antihypertensive agents in the elderly. Therefore they may be appropriate as a first choice in young and middle-age hypertensives, and in those with fast heart rate, but they should not be considered appropriate as the first-line therapy in the elderly with uncomplicated hypertension. Several years ago a plethora of publications showed that short-acting calcium antagonists may increase the risk for myocardial infarction and cancer. A few years ago two studies showed that calcium antagonists are less effective than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing cardiovascular events in diabetic hypertensive patients. However, recent results from large prospective randomized studies showed that calcium antagonists reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic and non-diabetic hypertensive patients. Some investigators have suggested that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of myocardial infarction in hypertensive patients. However, recent meta analyses refuted this conclusions and showed that ARBs are probably as effective as other antihypertensive agents in prevention of myocardial infarction. Despite the concern that has been raised regarding the long-term safety of some antihypertensive agents, it is clear that lowering BP is safe and beneficial. [References: 108]
