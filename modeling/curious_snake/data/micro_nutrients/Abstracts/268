The 2003 guidelines for the management of hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease compiled by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation (NKF-K/DOQI) were formulated on the basis of work published up until 2001. Since then, new drugs (e.g. calcimimetics and lanthanum carbonate) have become available, and others (e.g. sevelamer, nicotinamide and paricalcitol) have been more stringently clinically evaluated. Because of these advancements, a reappraisal of the 2003 guidelines is justified. In this article we critically review the following recommendations of the NKF-K/DOQI: (i) routine use of 1.25 mmol/l (5.0 mg/dl) dialysate calcium and 1 alphaOH-vitamin D derivatives; (ii) limitation of the maximal daily dose of calcium-based oral phosphate binders to 1.5 g of elemental calcium; and (iii) not correcting vitamin D insufficiency in dialysis patients
