An International Task Force made up of a panel of 16 experts has reviewed and objectively evaluated all aspects of chronic venous disease of the leg (CVDL). All available publications on CVDL from 1983 to 1997 were identified through computerized search in Medline and by a manual search. Next, three different screenings were performed in order to select only relevant papers providing a level of scientific evidence that was considered moderate to strong. Final conclusions and further therapeutic recommendations were made based on these publications. Medication, compression, local therapy, sclerotherapy, and surgery are the accepted available therapeutic options for CVDL. For edema, the following recommendations can be made: edema is an early sign of CVDL, but before starting any treatment, nonvenous causes of edema should be excluded. Medication and compression are the therapeutic options for edema that are accepted by the Task Force. Evaluation of their efficacy is based on objective measures of edema. Several well-conducted, placebo-controlled trials have shown efficacy of drugs such as micronized purified flavonoid fraction, rutosides, calcium dobesilate, and coumarin rutin. Graduated compression stockings have been shown to be effective; compression needs to be exerted at least at 35 mm Hg. Bandages, if properly applied, both fixed and stretched, can produce favorable results. Sclerotherapy or surgery is not indicated unless there is saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal reflux. In the absence of such reflux or following deep venous thrombosis, there is no evidence to support sclerotherapy or surgery
