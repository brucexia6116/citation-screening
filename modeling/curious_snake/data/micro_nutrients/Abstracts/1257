Retinoid therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is one of the major achievements of leukemia research in the last 15 years. Use of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has changed the prognosis of APL from a fatal leukemia to a highly curable disease. This case-based review examines the available clinical and scientific data to form evidence-based decisions in the management of APL. The main aim of this review is to highlight recent progress made in the management of APL and address the role of maintenance therapy, prognostic factors for relapse and treatment of relapsed disease.
