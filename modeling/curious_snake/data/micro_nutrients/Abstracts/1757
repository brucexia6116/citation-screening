The objective of this study was to explore explanations for the preference of physicians to prescribe beta-blockers to hypertensive men and diuretics to hypertensive women. A qualitative study among 12 family physicians was conducted with a combination of written case simulations, semi-structured interviews and statements on attitudes of physicians towards antihypertensive drug choice. Among the male hypertensive cases the most frequently prescribed drugs were beta-blockers, whereas among the female hypertensive cases diuretics were more often prescribed. Physician characteristics associated with a preferred prescribing of beta-blockers to hypertensive men and diuretics to hypertensive women were: older age (no residency in family medicine), the believe that beta-blockers are more effective in men with regard to lowering blood pressure and that diuretics are more effective in women, a non-evidence based attitude and a sex-related attitude towards the choice of beta-blockers and diuretics in general, and in particular towards the prescribing of beta-blockers to hypertensive men because men have a higher absolute risk of coronary heart disease than women. An additional explanation for these findings may be the higher prevalence of ankle oedema among women. Patient characteristics associated with more prescribing of beta-blockers to hypertensive men and diuretics to hypertensive women were: current employment and a "high-risk" profile in terms of blood pressure level and additional cardiovascular risk factors. Although, most considerations underlying a preferred prescribing of beta-blockers to hypertensive men and diuretics to hypertensive women were not evidence-based, the actual choice of antihypertensive drug (diuretic or beta-blocker) was evidence-based. These considerations may also play a role in the sex difference in the choice of calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and require further investigation
