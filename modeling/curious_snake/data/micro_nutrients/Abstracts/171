About 14% of adults in the UK have migraines. Drugs used in migraine prophylaxis include beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol), 5HT antagonists (e.g. pizotifen), antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), antiepileptics (e.g. sodium valproate) and NSAIDs. The antiepileptic topiramate (Topamax-Janssen-Cilag) is licensed for the prophylaxis of migraine headache in patients aged over 16 years. Here we discuss the place of topiramate in migraine prophylaxis. [References: 24]
