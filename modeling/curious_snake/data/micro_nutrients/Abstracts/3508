This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, To evaluate the effect of taurine supplementation for preterm or low birth weight infants on growth and development. We plan to examine the evidence of effect of enteral and parenteral taurine supplementation in separate comparisons., If sufficient data are available we plan to undertake the following subgroup analyses:, 1. Trials where participants were predominantly (more than 80%) very low birth weight (less than 1.5 kilograms) or very preterm (born before 32 weeks' gestation) infants versus trials where participants were predominantly more mature or higher birth weight preterm infants., 2. Trials where the aim was to give more than 9 milligrams per kilogram per day of taurine (more than the enteral intake recommended by ) versus trials where less taurine supplementation was given
