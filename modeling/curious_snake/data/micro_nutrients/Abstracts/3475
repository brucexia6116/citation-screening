This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, Primary Objectives:, To compare the effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators versus antiarrhythmic drugs (or placebo) for reducing total mortality in:, 1. Primary prevention: intervention in patients with left ventricular dysfunction who have not had an episode of resuscitated cardiac death., 2. Secondary prevention: intervention after an episode of resuscitated sudden cardiac death or symptomatic arrhythmic event., Secondary Objectives:, 1. To determine the effectiveness of implantable defibrillators versus antiarrhythmic drugs (or placebo) in prevention of cardiac arrhythmic death in primary and secondary prevention studies., 2. To determine the effect of implantable defibrillators versus antiarrhythmic drugs (or placebo) on cardiac non-arrhythmic death in primary and secondary prevention studies., 3. To review adverse events associated with the defibrillator and medical therapy strategies., 4. To review cost-effectiveness studies performed as ancillary sub studies of the randomized trials
