Painful bladder syndrome (PBS) is the term used to refer to a chronic symptom complex of urinary frequency and bladder 'pressure', discomfort or pain in the absence of any other reasonable cause for these symptoms (such as infection). Interstitial cystitis (IC) is the established term used by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) consensus workshop for which a research definition was formulated in the late 1980s. Opinion varies regarding not only definition but also the usefulness of diagnostic investigations such as urodynamic assessment and the potassium sensitivity test. There are still controversies concerning the most basic investigation of cystoscopy in PBS/IC. New developments in the study of PBS/IC include the identification of a potential urinary biomarker, antiproliferative factor (APF), which is produced by urothelial cells in IC and thought to inhibit proliferation. In addition, condition-specific validated questionnaires should aid evaluation, and a growing number of randomised controlled trials should enable clinicians to use evidence-based therapeutic options.
