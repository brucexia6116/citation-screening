This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:, The purpose of this review is to determine if certain washout regimens are better than others in terms of effectiveness, acceptability, complications, quality of life and economics for the management of long-term indwelling urinary catheterisation in adults., The following hypotheses will be tested:, 1) using any type of catheter washout (e.g. water, saline, antiseptic, antifungal, antibiotic) is better than not using one;, 2) one type of catheter washout solution is better than another type;, 3) clinically or microbiologically indicated washout is better than routine washout;, 4) long intervals between catheter washouts are better than short intervals;, 5) one method of administration of catheter washouts (e.g. agitation, gravity, syringe) is better than another method;, 6) smaller volumes of washout solution are better than larger volumes;, 7) a stronger solution of washout is better than a weaker solution;, 8) a single washout instillation is better than two or more sequential washout instillations of the same type., Some studies may address more than one hypothesis
