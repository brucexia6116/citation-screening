PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In view of the ongoing controversy about the importance of dietary sodium intake in blood pressure control, consideration of the most recent findings in this area is useful. RECENT FINDINGS: New observations regarding the relation between salt intake and its reduction on blood pressure have emerged. Evidence regarding physiologic factors associated with the increased sensitivity of blood pressure to salt and the relation of this increased sensitivity to other cardiovascular disease risk factors and disorders of end-organ function have been reported. Several meta-analyses and assessments of the impact of interventions on the global risk of cardiovascular disease have also been presented. SUMMARY: Compelling evidence of the role of salt intake on blood pressure and on other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, as well as new information regarding the feasibility of reducing salt intake, call for renewed efforts in this area as a major influence in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
