Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is involved in one-carbon metabolism. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a common phenomenon among elderly people. There is growing evidence of an association between hyperhomocysteinemia and geriatric multisystem problems, including coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, cognitive impairment, dementia, depression, osteoporotic fractures, and functional decline. The proposed mechanisms of the association include angiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and inhibition of collagen cross-linking. A homocysteine-lowering strategy may prevent or slow the development of these age-related problems. Vitamin supplementation and folic acid fortification of grain foods have been shown to decrease plasma homocysteine concentrations. More research is needed to investigate whether lifelong homocysteine lowering can prevent the development of late-life morbidity. [References: 137]
