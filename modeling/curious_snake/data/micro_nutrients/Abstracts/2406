The plasma concentration versus antihypertensive effect relationship for the calcium antagonist felodipine was investigated in 67 patients with hypertension and 21 healthy subjects by use of the Emax model. No consistent effect of felodipine on blood pressure was observed in the healthy subjects. In patients with hypertension the plasma drug concentration and blood pressure versus time curves mirrored each other, indicating a close relationship between concentration and effect. The maximum effect (Emax) model fitted the diastolic blood pressure data of most patients, but the model was less often applicable in patients with low initial diastolic blood pressure levels. The average Emax values and the plasma felodipine concentration needed to obtain 50% of Emax for the patients with hypertension were 29 mm Hg and 8 nmol/L, respectively. The Emax values increased with increasing initial diastolic blood pressure levels but were similar in patients with high and low plasma felodipine concentrations. Age had negligible influence on the antihypertensive response to felodipine when compensation was made for the plasma concentrations
