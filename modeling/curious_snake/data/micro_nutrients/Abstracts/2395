The efficacy of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid as antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery has been assessed in numerous clinical studies, chiefly in abdominal and gynaecological surgery. A meta-analysis of 21 trials covering 2685 patients given amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and 2220 patients given comparator regimens is presented. Monotherapy with amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was as effective as the comparators, including combination regimens utilizing gentamicin or metronidazole, in preventing wound infections (median wound infection rates were 6% and 10% respectively). The antibacterial activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid covers the broad range of aerobic Gram-negative and anaerobic organisms that have a major role in postoperative infections. In addition, amoxycillin-clavulanic acid may have benefits in terms of convenience, tolerance and cost
