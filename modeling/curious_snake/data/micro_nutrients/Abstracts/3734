The latest considerations in the management of iron-deficiency anemia in patients on hemodialysis have centered on the updated guidelines and recommendations issued by the National Kidney Foundation, with interest on appropriate hemoglobin and serum ferritin targets. With practices evolving in the anemia environment, it is necessary for nurses to stay informed of new evidence-based data and practical solutions to improve patient outcomes. This underscores the importance of a team approach to managing anemia and balanced therapy with intravenous iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. A symposium held during the 2007 annual meeting of the American Nephrology Nurses' Association addressed these issues. This article is based on the presentations and discussions from that symposium.
