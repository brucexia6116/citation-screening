The use of isotonic sodium chloride on endotracheal suctioning is still commonly performed in intensive care units (ICUs). According to the studies, isotonic sodium chloride instillation may decrease oxygen saturation, increased intracranial pressure, arterial blood pressure, and cause cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, and nosocomial infection. Endotracheal suctioning should not be used as a routine or standard clinical practice because of these negative effects. This article reviews effects of isotonic sodium chloride solution before endotracheal suctioning of mechanically ventilated patients. [References: 25]
