Calcium supplements have been shown to decrease the risk of colorectal adenomas. In this issue of the Journal, Shaukat et al. report the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of calcium supplementation.

The results of this meta-analysis support a preventive role for calcium supplements
