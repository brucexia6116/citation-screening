Background, Fibroids are benign tumours of the uterus occurring in up to 77% of women. Fibroids have been noted to occur more frequently in women with infertility. Retrospective studies have suggested the benefit of surgically removing fibroids to increase the fertility efficacy of both natural conception and assisted conception. There are a variety of methods to surgically remove fibroids including laparotomy, laparoscopy and hysteroscopy. The relative advantages and disadvantages of these modalities in terms of fertility efficacy and side effects are unknown., Objectives, To determine the efficacy and safety of the removal of uterine fibroids in subfertile women by laparotomy, laparoscopy or hysteroscopy when compared with expectant management or each other. The review will include also new surgical approaches as and when they are trialed., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Review Group Specialised register of controlled trials, MEDLINE (PUBMED) 1985 to 2004, EMBASE (1985 to 2004), CINAHL (1985 to 2004) and National Research Register., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which fibroids were removed via surgery for the treatment of infertility, Data collection and analysis, Three authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data., Main results, Only one randomized controlled study was included (131 women) and this was probably underpowered. There was no evidence of a difference in outcome in terms of clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate when fibroids were removed via laparotomy or laparoscopy for infertility. There were some non fertility benefits of removal via laparoscopy including shorter hospital stay, less febrile illness and a smaller drop in pre-operative haemoglobin concentration when compared to laparotomy., There were no randomised controlled studies comparing hysteroscopic removal or no intervention with other surgical modalities., Authors' conclusions, There is limited evidence to suggest that there is no difference in fertility efficacy outcome if fibroids are removed via laparotomy when compared to laparoscopy. There is no good randomised controlled evidence to support hysteroscopic removal of fibroids compared to other surgical modalities for fertility efficacy
