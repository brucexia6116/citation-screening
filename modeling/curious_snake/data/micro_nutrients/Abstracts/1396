OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence-based management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum. EVIDENCE: MEDLINE and Cochrane database searches were performed using the medical subject headings (MeSH) of treatment, nausea, vomiting, pregnancy, and hyperemesis gravidarum. The quality of evidence reported in these guidelines has been described using the Evaluation of Evidence criteria outlined in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Exam. BENEFITS: NVP has a profound effect on women's health and quality of life during pregnancy, as well as a financial impact on the health care system, and its early recognition and management are recommended. (III-B) COST: Costs, including hospitalizations, additional office visits, and time lost from work, may be reduced if NVP is treated early
