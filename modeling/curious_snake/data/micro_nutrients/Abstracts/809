The two-compound product containing calcipotriol 50 microg/g plus betamethasone dipropionate 0.5 mg/g (Dovobet, Daivobet) [referred to here as calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate], is a topical treatment for psoriasis vulgaris, combining a vitamin D analog and a corticosteroid. For most adult patients with psoriasis vulgaris on the trunk and limbs, up to 4 weeks of therapy with calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate provides an effective and well tolerated treatment. In clinical trials, patients with a mean baseline psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 9.5-10.9 experienced a mean 65.0-74.4% PASI improvement within 4 weeks, significantly better than improvements with calcipotriol 50 microg/g monotherapy, betamethasone dipropionate 0.5 mg/g monotherapy, or placebo. In addition, in 6.4%-20.1% of patients, lesions cleared. In patients who were subsequently treated with calcipotriol maintenance therapy, benefits were retained for at least 4 weeks. The safety of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate in patients treated for up to 1 year was generally good; fewer than 5% of patients experienced adverse events possibly associated with long-term corticosteroid use
