Lacidipine is a calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine group that is highly selective for vascular tissues. It has been tested during the last few years for the treatment of arterial hypertension. We evaluated the clinical position of this calcium antagonist on the basis of clinical results. From the dose-ranging studies carried out to determine the efficacy of lacidipine, it has been shown that the dose range of 2-6 mg of lacidipine given once daily is effective in reducing blood pressure levels. Lacidipine efficacy (4-6 mg/o.d.) also has been compared with that of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the calcium-antagonist nifedipine, and the beta-blocker atenolol in three different clinical trials according to the same protocol. The results indicated that lacidipine, hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, and atenolol caused similar reductions both in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 1 and 2 months of treatment. Similar blood pressure levels were also reached when another antihypertensive agent (atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide) had been added in nonresponders to monotherapy. Heart rate showed a significant decrease only under atenolol treatment, either monotherapy or associated to the previous treatment. In these comparison studies, tolerability was also evaluated. The incidence of side effects during lacidipine treatment was lower than during nifedipine or atenolol treatment, but higher than during hydrochlorothiazide therapy. Lacidipine did not cause any changes in the laboratory parameters evaluated during the 2-month monotherapy period. From a trial conducted in elderly patients, lacidipine 2 and 4 mg/o.d. has been shown to cause similar diastolic blood pressure reduction after 1 month of treatment, the effect being more gradual with the lower dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
