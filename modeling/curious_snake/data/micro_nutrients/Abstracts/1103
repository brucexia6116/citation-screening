Introduction of the computerized physician order (CPOE) is intended to promote best practices, decrease practice variation among practitioners, and optimize the utilization of resources consistent with evidence based practice guidelines.

Conversely compliance with practice guidelines may necessitate ordering of certain tests that are deemed to be consistent with the good practice of medicine. In order to develop an understanding of these issues, we compared the utilization of laboratory orders prior to and following implementation of order sets in CPOE. In addition, we analyzed the impact of CPOE on the timely placement of certain orders based on critical levels of some laboratory results, in this instance potassium
