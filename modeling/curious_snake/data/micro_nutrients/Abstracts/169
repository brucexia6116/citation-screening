Over the past 10 years, there have been 137 patient safety incidents in England associated with methotrexate prescribing. Recent reports show that Australia has similar concerns. Using the valuable tool of an audit, we reviewed our departmental prescribing practices for 49 patients with psoriasis on methotrexate. Results highlighted poor documentation that patients were receiving appropriate information sheets detailing complications of the drug. Inconsistencies between prescribers were also noted, particularly in regards to haematological monitoring. A review of the current published work and the guidelines of other leading centres was performed and consistent, evidence-based guidelines were produced for the department. Such guidelines are essential in order to minimize the recognized complications of methotrexate. Recent studies highlight procollagen peptide III as a valuable adjunct for monitoring hepatotoxicity, while there is no longer a significant role for routine recording of cumulative dose. It would be valuable to repeat the audit to ensure a change in practice and an improved adherence to common guidelines
