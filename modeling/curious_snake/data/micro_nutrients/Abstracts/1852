The progressive loss of social and physical functioning associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) results in extensive social and economic costs to society. The early diagnosis and treatment of AD may reduce cognitive and behavioral symptoms of this disease and may slow disease progression, thereby alleviating some of these social and economic costs. The Alzheimer's Disease Managed Care Advisory Council, a panel of experts from managed care, academic medicine, and the Los Angeles chapter of the Alzheimer's Association was convened to synthesize current evidence-based recommendations for AD diagnostic and treatment guidelines and to integrate these guidelines for use in MCOs. This paper presents conclusions from this panel and provides an algorithm for the treatment of AD specifically for managed care settings. When combined with other necessary efforts to educate providers, these guidelines should improve the cost-effectiveness and quality of care for individuals with dementia in managed care
