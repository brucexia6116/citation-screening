OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a new formula (Prenan), which contains n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC PUFA) on the fatty acid profile of preterm infants. METHODOLOGY: Plasma fatty acids were measured in 61 preterm infants at term by gas liquid chromatography. In 20 of these infants, paired samples were collected and changes in fatty acids with time 22 analysed. RESULTS: Plasma docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels were higher in those who had been fed expressed breast milk (EBM) +/-/or Prenan compared with those fed standard formula +/- EBM, P < 0.05. The plasma arachidonic acid (AA) levels of infants fed Prenan were not different to those fed EBM, both groups achieving higher levels than infants fed standard formula, P < 0.05. Further, paired analysis demonstrated that DHA levels increased in infants changed from standard formula to Prenan to levels equal or higher than those of fully breast-fed infants (P < 0.01), whereas DHA levels remained unchanged with time in all other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The fatty acid composition of Prenan enables preterm infants fed formula to have plasma DHA and AA levels similar to those of infants fed breast milk and consequently different to those of infants fed standard formula. Prenan is an appropriate supplement to breast milk for preterm infants in that it provides LC PUFA as well as additional phosphorus and protein without exposing the infant to intact cows milk protein
