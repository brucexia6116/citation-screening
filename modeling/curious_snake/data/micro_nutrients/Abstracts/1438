PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED: Pregnancy planning is inadequately supported by existing information and materials. OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM: To design and pilot-test a new way to help women plan their pregnancies and incorporate important evidence-based information directly into their planning. To evaluate the content of the new Pregnancy Planning Guide and women's satisfaction with it. MAIN COMPONENTS OF PROGRAM: The Pregnancy Planning Guide combines a rotating gestational wheel surrounded by information about time-specific events in pregnancy with evidence-based information about common concerns during pregnancy. The guide is designed to be used as a quick reference for women and their partners; it highlights issues to be discussed at greater length with maternity caregivers. The guide was first evaluated for content validity by 27 experienced maternity caregivers and then revised. The revised version was given to 108 women of childbearing age along with a survey to assess their satisfaction with the guide and the extent to which they thought it was useful. CONCLUSION: The Pregnancy Planning Guide is useful for women planning pregnancy. It should promote increased use of folic acid in the periconception period and a greater understanding of when birth is likely to occur
