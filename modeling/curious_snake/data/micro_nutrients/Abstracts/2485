A major task confronting those who establish calcium recommendations is the determination of a minimum level of calcium intake that will promote bone mineralization and/or reduce bone demineralization sufficiently to aid in the prevention of osteoporosis. The evidence reviewed here indicates that physical activity plays a primary role in the maintenance of skeletal integrity. Thus, to obtain data on calcium recommendations that are relevant to the general population, it is essential that calcium requirement studies use subjects whose physical activity profile is representative of the general population.
