Randomized trials in which the unit of randomization is a community, worksite, school or family are becoming widely used in the evaluation of life-style interventions for the prevention of disease. The increasing interest in adopting a cluster randomization design is being matched by rapid methodological developments. In this paper we describe several of these developments. Brief mention is also made of issues related to economic analysis and to the planning and conduct of meta-analyses for cluster randomization trials. Recommendations for reporting are also discussed.
