The objective of the study was to investigate various aspects of evidence-based dental prophylaxis education in postdoctoral pediatric dentistry training programs in the United States. An anonymous nationwide postal survey of fifty-two postdoctoral pediatric dentistry program directors was conducted in September 2001. The survey had a response rate of 75 percent with all geographic regions of the nation represented and with a preponderance of university-based programs (62 percent). Most of the training programs (74 percent) routinely recommended dental prophylaxis for all recall patients. The proportion of programs that recommended dental prophylaxis for the following indications were: plaque, stain and/or calculus removal--97 percent; caries prevention--59 percent; prior to topical fluoride application--67 percent; prior to sealant application--62 percent; and for behavioral modification--77 percent. Most training programs (77 percent) defined dental prophylaxis as both rubber cup pumice prophylaxis and toothbrush prophylaxis. However, only one-half of the training programs (51 percent) had modified their teaching to substitute toothbrush prophylaxis in lieu of rubber cup pumice prophylaxis. In conclusion, only one half of postdoctoral pediatric dentistry training programs in the United States teach evidence-based practice of dental prophylaxis for recall patients
