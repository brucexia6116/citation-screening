BACKGROUND: Glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) therapy has been advocated for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. However, the results from the clinical trials have been inconclusive, largely because of the small number of patients recruited and discrepancies between protocols used in these studies. METHOD AND RESULTS: A systematic MEDLINE search for all the randomized placebo-controlled studies of GIK therapy in acute myocardial infarction was made, and a meta-analysis of the mortality data was performed. Fifteen trials were identified, 5 were excluded because of poor randomization, and 1 was excluded because recruitment was limited to diabetic patients. The 9 remaining trials with a total of 1932 patients were included in the analysis. Hospital mortality was reduced from 21% (205 of 972 patients) in the placebo group to 16.1% (154 of 956) in the GIK group (P=.004; odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.90). The proportional mortality reduction was 28% (CI, 10% to 43%). The number of lives saved per 1000 patients treated was 49 (95% CI, 14 to 83). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that GIK therapy may have an important role in reducing the in-hospital mortality after acute myocardial infarction. The value of this therapy in the era of thrombolysis and acute revascularization by primary angioplasty can be fully resolved only by conducting a large randomized mortality study
