Second-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers slightly increase cardiac index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and exercise treadmill tests in patients with chronic heart failure, and do not increase norepinephrine levels; these drugs seem to be safe and beneficial in this category of patients.
