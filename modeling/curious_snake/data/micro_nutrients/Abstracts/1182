Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MN) has a variable rate of progression to end-stage renal failure, with a significant number of patients going into spontaneous remission without therapy. For those who have persistent nephrotic proteinuria or manifest deterioration of renal function, steroids and immunosuppressive drugs are used. However, their long-term efficacy is challenged by a meta-analysis presented here. A different approach to reduction of proteinuria, a recognized progression promoter, is based on the notion that angiotensin II inhibition controls proteinuria and slows progression. Further, a more complex approach is required than simple administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor: a multidrug approach to remission of nephrotic syndrome therefore is described here
