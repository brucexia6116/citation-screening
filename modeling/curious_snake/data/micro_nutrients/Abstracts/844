Preeclampsia-eclampsia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in mothers, fetuses, and neonates worldwide, most devastating in developing nations. Its cause is still uncertain, and many controversies exist concerning its management. The World Health Organization is aware of this and is coordinating a series of systematic reviews that focus on the etiology and the best strategies for the screening, prevention, and treatment of preeclampsia. This article summarizes results from systematic reviews of randomized trials to prevent and manage preeclampsia. There is a prophylactic role of modest magnitude for low-dose aspirin but the number to treat (90 women) to avoid one case of preeclampsia still is considered high. Antioxidant and calcium supplement trials remain to be completed before firm conclusions can be rendered on their efficacy for prevention. Magnesium sulfate is effective in preventing and treating eclampsia, while severe hypertension (with or without proteinuria) requires drug therapy, but there appears to be no benefits to treating mild to moderate hypertension without proteinuria in pregnancy. Finally, our review focuses on the quality of data reviewed, suggesting the need for better evidence, and discusses the use of systematic reviews as a strategy to focus future research on this important area of reproductive medicine.
