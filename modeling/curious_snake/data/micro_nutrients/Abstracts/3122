Background, Intrauterine devices (IUD) are safe and effective methods of long term reversible contraception. Design and copper content of IUDs could affect their effectiveness and side-effect profile., Objectives, We compared different copper IUDs for their effectiveness and side effects., Search strategy, Multiple electronic databases were searched with appropriate key words and names of the IUDs known to be in the market. We searched the reference lists of papers identified and contacted trialists when possible., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials comparing different IUDs were considered. Trials needed to report on clinical outcomes., Data collection and analysis, Data on outcomes and trial characteristics were extracted in duplicate and independently by two reviewers. Meta-analysis results are expressed as rate difference (RD) using a fixed-effects model with 95% confidence interval (CI). In the presence of significant heterogeneity a random-effects model was applied., Main results, We included 34 trials, resulting in 16 comparisons of different IUDs. TCu380A was more effective than MLCu375, MLCu250, TCu220 and TCu200. Changing the position of the copper on the arm of the IUD for TCu380S did not improve the efficacy of TCu380A. MLCu375 was no more effective than TCu220, at 1 year, MLCu250 to 3 years or NovaT to 3 years Compared to TCu380A, none of the IUDs showed any benefits in terms of bleeding or pain, or any of the other reasons for early discontinuation., Authors' conclusions, TCu380A is more effective compared to other IUDs. There is no data available comparing different IUDs in special subgroups, such as nulliparous women
