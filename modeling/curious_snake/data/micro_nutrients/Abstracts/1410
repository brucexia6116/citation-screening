The appropriate clinical use of serum iron and transferrin saturation (TSAT) requires satisfactory reference intervals from birth to old age, and for males and females. This study identified 54 publications from 1974 to 2001 that met the criteria used in three prior meta-analyses, and these were analyzed statistically. A summary of our review is presented along with our reference population data on these measurements. This analysis places previous publications in perspective and suggests possible reasons for the observed differences. Previous studies of the individual analytes, serum iron, transferrin, and TSAT values agree with the reference ranges presented in this study, although the entire experience over time and between sexes has not been available before. Our 95% reference ranges are somewhat broader than those of the smaller studies, but they agree well with those of the larger ones. Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc
