Organophosphate (OP) poisoning is commonly encountered in agricultural communities. The mainstay of therapy in OP poisoning is the use of atropine. However, several other therapies have been evaluated. Although oxime has been the most studied antidote, results in humans have been disappointing and limited by the lack of well-designed, prospective, randomised controlled trials. The key factor in determining outcomes in OP poisoning appears to be the timing of antidote administration. Other adjuvants, such as magnesium, fresh frozen plasma and haemoperfusion appear promising, and need to be explored further. A multi-faceted approach may be the answer to improving outcomes in OP poisoning. This review evaluates the advances in OP management over the last 20 years. [References: 65]
